Therefore, proper clearance and regulation are essential to maintain various physiological processes carried out by the cellular mechanism, including mitophagy and autophagy, by breaking down the damaged intracellular connections under the influence of various genes and proteins and protecting against various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Huntington disease (HD). In this review, we will discuss the role of autophagy, selective macroautophagy, or mitophagy, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases along with normal physiology. In addition, this review will provide a better understanding of the pathways involved in neuron autophagy and mitophagy and how mutations affect these pathways in the various genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Various new findings indicate that the pathways that remove dysfunctional mitochondria are impaired in these diseases, leading to the deposition of damaged mitochondria. Apart from that, we have also discussed the therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases.

This study analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics and proteomics data obtained from several data repositories to obtain differentially expressed (DE) multi-omics elements in mouse models of AD. We characterized the metabolic modulation in these datasets using gene ontology, transcription factor, pathway, and cell-type enrichment analyses. A predicted lipid signature was extracted from genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN) and subsequently validated in a lipidomic dataset derived from cortical tissue of ABCA-7 null mice, a mouse model of one of the genes associated with late onset AD. Moreover, a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed to further characterize the association between dysregulated lipid metabolism in human blood serum and genes associated with AD risk. We found 203 DE transcripts, 164 DE proteins and 58 DE GWAS-derived mouse orthologs associated with significantly enriched metabolic biological processes. Lipid and bioenergetics metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented across the AD multi-omics datasets. Microglia and astrocytes were significantly enriched in the lipid-predominant AD-metabolic transcriptome. We also extracted a predicted lipid signature that was validated and robustly modelled class separation in the ABCA7 mice cortical lipidome, with 11 of these lipid species exhibiting statistically significant modulations. MWAS revealed 298 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-metabolite associations, of which 70% corresponded to lipid classes.

Visual system might be precociously altered, especially for its cholinergic connections. We thus studied patients with aMCI compared to AD with paired-pulse flash-visual evoked potentials (paired-F-VEPs), a putative marker of cholinergic function. Methods. We enrolled 12 adult patients with aMCI and 12 with AD. 14 normal age- and sex-matched subjects acted as controls (HS). Stimuli were single flashes, with interspersed random flash pairs at critical interstimulus intervals (ISIs, 16.5 to 125&#8197;ms) with closed eyes. The \"single\" (unconditioned) F-VEP was split into a \"main complex\" (50 to 200&#8197;ms after the flash) and a \"late response\" (200 to 400&#8197;ms). As for paired stimulation, the \"test\" F-VEP emerged from electronic subtraction of the \"single\" F-VEP from the \"paired\"-F-VEP. Results. In the single F-VEP, P2 latency was prolonged in patients (aMCI and AD) compared to HS (p&#8201;<&#8201;.05).

No changes were detected for the \"main complex\". Conclusions. Paired-F-VEPs demonstrate a defective neural inhibition in the visual system of patients with aMCI at critical intervals. It may represent a compensatory mechanism against neuronal loss, the failure of which may be involved in AD development.

NPI total scores at baseline and year-one visits were used to operationalize MBI (score>0 at both visits), NPS not meeting MBI criteria (NPS-not-MBI, score>0 at only one visit), and no-NPS (score=0 at both visits). Linear regressions were fitted for cross-sectional analyses; multilevel linear mixed-effects and Cox proportional hazards models were implemented to examine longitudinal associations of MBI with changes in p-tau181 and cognition, and incident dementia.The sample included 571 participants (age 72.2, 46.8% female, 64.8% MCI). Cross-sectionally (Beta=8.1%, 95%CI:1.4%-15.2%, p=0.02) MBI was associated with higher plasma ptau-181 levels compared to no-NPS; NPS-not-MBI was not. Longitudinally, MBI was associated with higher p-tau181 (Beta=0.014%, 95%CI:0.003-0.026, p=0.02), in addition to a decline in memory and executive function. Survival analyses demonstrated a 3.92-fold greater dementia incidence in MBI, with no significant differences between NPS-not-MBI and no-NPS.These findings extend the evidence base that MBI is associated with elevated risk of cognitive decline and dementia, and a sequela of emerging Alzheimer-related proteinopathies.

Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network.

To gain a detail of calcium ions' role in the full-length A&#946;1-42 and A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ monomers contact, the cellular membrane before their aggregation to elucidate the neurotoxicity mechanism, we carried out 2.5&#160;&#956;s extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MD) to rigorous explorations of the intriguing feature of the A&#946;1-42 and A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ interaction with the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayer in the presence of calcium ions. The outcome of the results compared to the same simulations without calcium ions. We surprisingly noted robust binding energies between the A&#946;1-42 and membrane observed in simulations containing without calcium ions and is two and a half fold lesser in the simulation with calcium ions. Therefore, in the case of the absence of calcium ions, N-terminal residues of A&#946;1-42 deeply penetrate from the surface to the center of the bilayer; in contrast to calcium ions presence, the N- and C-terminal residues are involved only in surface contacts through binding phosphate moieties. On the other hand, A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ actively participated in surface bilayer contacts in the absence of calcium ions. These contacts are prevented by forming a calcium bridge between A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ and the DMPC bilayer in the case of calcium ions presence. In a nutshell, Calcium ions do not allow A&#946;1-42 penetration into the membranes nor contact of A&#946;1-42 -Cu2+ with the membranes.

Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A&#946;-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A&#946; plaques (average age of death of 83.1&#160;yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001).

According to several studies, the critical factor in this relationship is brain insulin resistance. Due to the rapid global spread of both diseases, overcoming this cross-talk has a significant impact on societies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), on the other hand, have a substantial impact on complex diseases due to their ability to influence gene expression via a variety of mechanisms. Consequently, the regulation of lncRNA expression in chronic diseases permits the development of innovative therapeutic techniques. However, developing a new drug requires considerable time and money. Recently repurposing existing drugs has gained popularity due to the use of low-risk compounds, which may result in cost and time savings. in this study,&#160;we identified drug repurposing candidates capable of controlling the expression of common lncRNAs in the cross-talk between DM and AD. We also utilized drugs that interfered with this cross-talk. To do this, high degree common lncRNAs were extracted from microRNA-lncRNA bipartite network. The drugs that interact with the specified lncRNAs were then collected from multiple data sources. These drugs, referred to as set D, were classified in to positive (D+) and negative (D-) groups based on their effects on the expression of the interacting lncRNAs. A feature selection algorithm was used to select six important features for D. Using a random forest classifier, these features were capable of classifying D+ and D- with an accuracy of 82.5%. Finally, the same six features were extracted for the most recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs in order to identify those with the highest likelihood of belonging to D+ or D-. The most significant FDA-approved positive drugs, chromium nicotinate and tapentadol, were presented as repurposing candidates, while cefepime and dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine were recommended as significant adverse drugs. Moreover, two natural compounds, curcumin and quercetin, were recommended to prevent this cross-talk.

We identified ANKLE2, BANF1, NUSAP1, EIF1AD, and VPS18 as the top validated regulators that restrict tau aggregation initiated by both exosomal and vesicle-free tau seeds. None of our validated hits affected the uptake of either form of tau seeds, supporting the notion that they operate through a cell-autonomous mechanism downstream of the seed uptake.

Two main forms of beta-amyloid in humans are 40 and 42-amino acid, long; the latter is considered more relevant to AD etiology. The concentration of soluble beta-amyloid-42 (A&#946;42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-A&#946;42) and the density of amyloid depositions have a strong negative correlation. However, AD patients have lower CSF-A&#946;42 levels compared to individuals with normal cognition (NC), even after accounting for this correlation. The goal of this study was to infer deviations of A&#946;42 metabolism parameters that underlie this difference using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. A&#946;42 is released to the interstitial fluid (ISF) by cells and is removed by several processes. First, growth of insoluble fibrils by aggregation decreases the concentration of soluble beta-amyloid in the ISF. Second, A&#946;42 is physically transferred from the brain to the CSF and removed with the CSF flow. Finally, there is an intratissue removal of A&#946;42 ending in proteolysis, which can occur either in the ISF or inside the cells after the peptide is endocytosed. Unlike aggregation, which preserves the peptide in the brain, transfer to the CSF and intratissue proteolysis together represent amyloid removal. Using a kinetic model of A&#946;42 turnover, we found that compared to NC subjects, AD patients had dramatically increased rates of amyloid removal. A group with late-onset mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) also exhibited a higher rate of amyloid removal; however, this was less pronounced than in the AD group. Estimated parameters in the early-onset MCI group did not differ significantly from those in the NC group. We hypothesize that increased amyloid removal is mediated by A&#946;42 cellular uptake; this is because CSF flow is not increased in AD patients, while most proteases are intracellular. A&#946; cytotoxicity depends on both the amount of beta-amyloid internalized by cells and its intracellular conversion into toxic products. We speculate that AD and LMCI are associated with increased cellular amyloid uptake, which leads to faster disease progression. The early-onset MCI (EMCI) patients do not differ from the NC participants in terms of cellular amyloid uptake.

Finally, we re-examined the findings in a subsample of amyloid-&#946;-verified AD.AES total score correlated negatively with hypothalamic precuneus (PCu)/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and positively with left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and supramarginal gyrus rsFCs. Behavioral subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic PCu/PCC and positively with middle frontal gyrus rsFC. Cognitive subscore correlated positively with hypothalamic MTG rsFC. Emotional subscore correlated negatively with hypothalamic calcarine cortex rsFC. In path analyses, hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC negatively modulated apathy and, in turn, depression. The model where hypothalamic MTG rsFC and memory independently modulated apathy also showed a good fit. The findings of diminished hypothalamic-PCu/PCC rsFC in relation to apathy and depression were confirmed in amyloid-verified AD.The findings together support a role of altered hypothalamic connectivity in relation to apathy and depression, and modulation of apathy by memory dysfunction.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36314208": {"ArticleTitle": "Reliability, Validity, and User-Experience of Remote Unsupervised Computerized Neuropsychological Assessments in Community-Living 55 to 75-Year-Olds.", "AbstractText": "Self-administered computerized neuropsychological assessments (CNAs) provide lower cost, more accessible alternatives to traditional in-person assessments but lack critical information on psychometrics and subjective experience of older adults in remote testing environments.We used an online brief battery of computerized tasks selected from the CogState Brief Battery (CBB) and Cambridge Brain Sciences (CBS) to 1) determine test-retest reliability in an unsupervised setting; 2) examine convergent validity with a comprehensive 'gold standard' paper-and-pencil neuropsychological test battery administered in-person; and 3) explore user-experience of remote computerized testing and individual tests.Fifty-two participants (mean age 65.8&#177;5.7 years) completed CBB and CBS tests on their own computer, unsupervised from home, on three occasions, and visited a research center for an in-person paper-and-pencil assessment.

The uterus weight decreased, and the body weight increased significantly in the OVX animals. The MRI data showed that the body weight change can be due to fat accumulation. Moreover, OVX increased anxiety in control, but decreased in 3xTg-AD animals, the later genotype being more anxious by default based on the anxiety z-score. In general, 3xTg-AD mice moved less. In relation to cognition, neither the 3xTg-AD genotype nor OVX surgery impaired learning and memory in general. Despite no progression of dementia-like behavior after OVX, at the&#160;histological level, OVX aggravated the amyloid-&#946; plaque deposition in the basolateral amygdala and induced early cholinergic neuronal fiber loss in the somatosensory cortex of the transgenic animals. We confirmed that OVX induced menopausal symptoms. Removal of the sexual steroids aggravated the appearance of AD-related alterations in the brain without significantly affecting the behavior. Thus, the OVX in young, 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice might be a suitable model for testing the effect of new treatment options on structural changes; however, to reveal any beneficial effect on behavior, a later time point might be needed.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36303331": {"ArticleTitle": "Adropin and MOTS-c as new peptides: Do levels change in neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke?", "AbstractText": "Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (AD, PD), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are thought to be deeply affected by changes in the pathophysiological processes of neurons.

Neuronal death leads to release of tau proteins which can become dephosphorylated, rephosphorylated or hyperphosphorylated in the setting of ischemia, possibly leading to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, a potential synergistic effect between development of tauopathy and cerebrovascular lesion burden may contribute to cognitive decline after stroke. We explored the spatial and temporal distribution of neurofibrillary tangles after ischemic stroke in vivo by using 18F-MK-6240 positron emission tomography (PET).We included patients with a first ischemic stroke to undergo longitudinal 18F-MK-6240 PET/MR within 2 to 4 weeks and 6 months after stroke. For cross-sectional analyses, we also included age-matched healthy controls. We delineated 5 volumes-of-interest based on T2 FLAIR and T1 MR data: the ischemic lesion, 3 consecutive peri-ischemic areas and the remaining ipsilesional hemisphere. We performed region-based voxel-wise partial volume correction on the PET data and calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with the cerebellum as reference region.We did not quantify PET scans of patients within the first month after stroke (n = 17; median age 73 years [IQR: 62-82]) since the signal intensity was influenced by blood brain barrier breakdown hampering a reliable data analysis. At 6 months after the event (n = 13; median age 71 years [IQR: 60-79]), 18F-MK-6240 SUVR was increased in the ischemic lesion compared to 20 age-matched healthy controls (median age 71.5 years [IQR: 66-76]; ratiolesion/controls = 1.62&#177;0.54; one-sample t-test: p = 0.0015) and gradually decreased in the surrounding tissue (one-way within-subject ANOVA(F(1.2, 14.8) = 18.0, p = 0.00043).These findings suggest that neurofibrillary tangles may form after ischemic stroke and spread in the peri-ischemic brain parenchyma.

The results indicated that the key interactions found in both donepezil and the selected hybrid donepezils were the &#960;-&#960; interaction to Trp86 in the catalytic anionic site (CAS) and Trp286 and Tyr341 in the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in the AChE binding pocket.

LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity.

When considering clinical biomarkers (A&#946;, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI.

To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity.

For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with Xenopus laevis phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the Xenopus secondary axis phenotype mediated by Xwnt8 injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3&#946; S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect.

Amyloid-&#946; plaques and tau aggregates have been observed in the post-mortem brains of TBI patients; however, the mechanisms leading to AD neuropathology in TBI are still unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that focal TBI induces changes in miRNA expression in and around affected areas, resulting in the altered expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration and AD pathology. For this purpose, we performed a miRNA array in extracts from rats subjected to experimental TBI, using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. In and around the contusion, we observed alterations of miRNAs associated with dementia/AD, compared to the contralateral side. Specifically, the expression of miR-9 was significantly upregulated, while miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-106b, miR-181a and miR-107 were downregulated. Via qPCR, we confirmed these results in an additional group of injured rats when compared to na&#239;ve animals. Interestingly, the changes in those miRNAs were concomitant with alterations in the gene expression of mRNAs involved in amyloid generation and tau pathology, such as &#946;-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and Glycogen synthase-3-&#946; (GSK3&#946;). In addition increased levels of neuroinflammatory markers (TNF-&#945;), glial activation, neuronal loss, and tau phosphorylation were observed in pericontusional areas.

To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging. We included 405 participants (53 AD, 66 MCI, 174 SCD, and 112 healthy controls) from the Deutsches Zentrum f&#252;r Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE) Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD.

Further analysis of AD patients' serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients' samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with A&#946;1-42.

This study included cognitively intact participants aged 60 to 90 years at baseline with annual follow-up from October 1997 to December 2020 (maximum follow-up of 22 years). During the follow-up, participants underwent brain autopsies. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to February 2022 using mixed-effect models.BMI was calculated using height and weight measured at baseline and follow-ups.Incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Neuropathological assessments (including global Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology) were performed for autopsies.A total of 1390 participants (mean [SD] age, 78.4 [6.5] years; 1063 female [76.5%]) were included in the study. In the analysis of BMI trajectories before MCI (n = 939), during the follow-up (median [IQR] duration, 6 [3-9] years), 371 participants (39.5%) developed MCI, of whom 88 (23.7%) progressed to dementia.

However, cellular senescence is characterized by additional changes, such as an irregular cell cycle arrest, and a variety of metabolic and molecular changes including a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, dysfunction of degradation mechanisms, and altered DNA damage response. Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging.

We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci. Further, MR estimates across complementary MR methods and additional models using genetic instruments derived from circulating PCSK9 protein levels and tissue-specific PCSK9 expression were in alignment, strengthening causal inference.

To date, the effects of Abeta42 accumulation on GABAergic synapses are poorly understood Our findings suggest that, similarly to what observed on glutamatergic synapses, Abeta42 modifies GABAergic synapses by targeting ryanodine receptors and causing calcium dysregulation The GABAergic impairments can be restored by the RyR-calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 Based on our research, RyRs stabilization may represent a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preventing or delaying of AD.Oligomeric form of amyloid beta protein Abeta42 contributes to the development of synaptic abnormalities and cognitive impairments associated with AD. To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRPsyn ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment. Abstract figure legend Left: pre- and postsynaptic neurons are represented under physiological conditions. At rest, ER membrane contains RyRs in closed state and the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous is shifted towards the asynchronous. Middle: Abeta42 causes calcium dysregulation by targeting RyRs which assume a leaky conformation. Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42. Right: S107, a RyCal compound, counteracts the effects induced by Abeta42 on GABAergic synapses by stabilizing RyRs in a close conformational configuration, recovering the size of RRP asynchronous and decreasing the number of release sites.

Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital. This review comprehensively summarize the results on WM abnormalities in AD and explores the relationship between OL progenitor cells and the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential future research directions are discussed.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281795": {"ArticleTitle": "FAD-Deficient P187S mutation of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1*2) binds and accelerates &#946;-amyloid aggregation.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases. Results from animal and cellular models suggest that FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 may accelerate the aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide Ab1-42. Here we examined in-vitro whether NQO1 and its FAD-deficient P187S mutation (NQO1*2) directly interact with Ab1-42 and modify its rate of aggregation. When monitored using the fluorescence of either non-covalent thioflavin T or HiLyte Fluor 647 dye covalently attached to the Ab1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD. Furthermore, dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor which binds near the FAD binding site and stabilizes NQO1*2, markedly decreased the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed in-vitro co-aggregation of NQO1 isoforms and Ab1-42. Ab1-42 alone forms rod shaped fibril structures while in the presence of NQO1 isoforms, Ab1-42 is incorporated in the middle of larger globular protein aggregates surrounded by NQO1 molecules. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicates that Ab1-42 interacts with NQO1 isoforms with a specific stoichiometry through a hydrophobic interaction with positive enthalpy and entropy changes. These data define the kinetics, mechanism, and shape of co-aggregates of Ab1-42 and NQO1 isoforms and the potential relevance of FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 for amyloid aggregation diseases.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281688": {"ArticleTitle": "Letter to the editor: Genetically Determined Alzheimer's Disease Is Associated with Increased Risk of Varicose Vein: A Mendelian Randomization Study.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281687": {"ArticleTitle": "Letter to the editor: Beyond Frailty in Alzheimer's Disease: Should We Move to the Concept of Intrinsic Capacity.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36281686": {"ArticleTitle": "Validation of the Saint Louis University Quality of Life Questionnaire in Older Adults with Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and negatively impacts individuals' quality of life (QOL).

Using a community-engaged research approach, we collaborated with predominately African American serving community-based organizations to support content development and delivery of Aging with Grace (AWG), a culturally tailored ADRD educational curriculum. A total of five AWG presentations were given to 66 attendees. Most attendees (67%) expressed interest in participating in clinical trials after attending AWG. Enrollment increased within an observational study (84%) and lifestyle prevention clinical trials (52%) from 2018 to 2019. Attendees (32%) also perceived an increase in ADRD knowledge from attending AWG and 89.1% believed more African Americans should participate in research. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored community education program to enhance knowledge, clinical trial interest, and recruitment into observational studies and lifestyle ADRD clinical trials among older African Americans.

Inhibiting epichaperomes induces degradation of disease associated proteins and is a promising therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's Disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.This Phase 1 clinical study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of icapamespib, a purine scaffold inhibitor of epichaperomes that is specific to epichaperomes, in healthy subjects.Double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalating single ascending dose and multiple ascending doses and an unblinded two-period cross-over bioavailability study design.Single site in the United States.Healthy men or women of 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, for Part 1 (single ascending dose), &#8805; 60 years of age for Part 2 (multiple ascending dose), or 18 to 49 years of age for Part 3 (bioavailability).In the single ascending dose group, oral single doses (10, 20, and 30 mg icapamespib or placebo) were administered to healthy non-elderly subjects. In the multiple ascending dose group, multiple doses (20 and 30 mg icapamespib once daily for 7 days or placebo) were administered to healthy elderly subjects. In the bioavailability group, the bioavailability of once daily oral icapamespib solution and tablet was assessed in healthy non elderly subjects.Safety was evaluated based on assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Icapamespib concentration was evaluated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, the latter in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) only.Forty-eight subjects in total were randomized and assessed for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability parameters as follows: 24 subjects in Part 1 (single ascending dose) with PU-AD 10 mg (n = 6), 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 6); 16 subjects in Part 2 (multiple ascending dose) with icapamespib 20 mg (n = 6), 30 mg (n = 6), and placebo (n = 4); and 8 subjects in Part 3 (bioavailability) crossed-over between icapamespib 30 mg (tablet) and icapamespib 30 mg (oral solution). Single doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg and multiple doses of icapamespib up to 30 mg for 7 days were generally safe and well tolerated in healthy non-elderly and elderly subjects.

When adjudication criteria were triggered, a participant's clinical information was randomly assigned to a three-member panel of a six-member independent adjudication committee. Determination of whether or not a participant reached MCI due to AD or AD dementia proceeded through up to three review stages - independent review, collaborative review, and full committee review - requiring a unanimous decision and ratification by the chair.Of 3494 participants randomized, the committee adjudicated on 648 cases from 386 participants, resulting in 96 primary endpoint events.

In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid &#946; is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid &#946; gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid &#946; expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid &#946; confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid &#946; expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid &#946; at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid &#946; is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid &#946; in the brain.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR&#945;-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR&#945;-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR&#945;-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR&#945; was inversely correlated with amyloid-&#946; plaques and &#946;-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03&#8197;&#181;l/g&#183;s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR&#946; that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier.

Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated.

Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment.

This inability to reflexively increase blood pressure on standing is a serious health concern and increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular diseases.Since there are no clear mechanisms for orthostatic hypotension in human AD, the present study assessed the autonomic changes that could explain this comorbidity in an AD animal model.We used the established streptozotocin-induced rat model of AD (STZ-AD), which mimics many hallmark symptoms of sporadic AD in humans. Baroreflex responses were analyzed in anesthetized STZ-AD rats using femoral catheterization for blood pressure and heart rate, and autonomic activity was assessed using specific blockers and splanchnic sympathetic nerve recordings. Expression levels of autonomic receptors at the heart were examined using the western blot technique.Baroreflex function in STZ-AD showed a blunted heart rate (HR) response to low blood pressure challenges, and the maximal sympathetic nerve activity was reduced. Conversely, HR responses to high blood pressure were similar to control, indicating no change in parasympathetic nerve activity. Under resting conditions, autonomic blockade demonstrated a baseline shift to increased sympathetic tone in STZ-AD. Protein expression levels of beta-1 adrenergic receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 in the heart were unchanged.Our study provides the first data on the pathological influence of AD on baroreflex function, which primarily affected the sympathetic nervous system in STZ-AD.

Then, a hybrid attention mechanism is presented, which enables the network to focus on target regions and learn feature weights, so as to enhance the network's learning ability of the lesion regions that are relevant to disease diagnosis. Finally, a joint loss function, that avoids the overfitting phenomenon, increases the generalization of the model, and improves prediction accuracy by adding a regularization loss function to the conventional cross-entropy function, is proposed.

Herein, three different 89Zr-labeling strategies and direct radioiodination with 125I of a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta aducanumab derivate, consisting of aducanumab with a C-terminal fused anti-transferrin receptor binding single chain Fab fragment derived from 8D3 (Adu-8D3), were compared ex vivo and in vivo with regard to brain uptake and target engagement in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model and wild type animals. Methods: Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-N-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. 125I was used as a substitute for 124I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 &#181;g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq 89Zr or 2.5 MBq 125I, were injected per mouse. PET imaging was performed 1, 3 and 7 days post injection (p.i.). All mice were sacrificed on day 7 p.i. and subjected to ex vivo biodistribution and brain autoradiography. Immunostaining on brain tissue was performed after autoradiography for further validation. Results: Ex vivo biodistribution revealed that the brain uptake of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 (2.19 &#177;0.12 %ID/g) was as high as for its 125I-analog (2.21 &#177;0.15 %ID/g). [89Zr]Zr-DFO-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [89Zr]Zr-DFO-N-suc-Adu-8D3 showed significantly lower uptake (< 0.65 %ID/g), being in the same range as for the 89Zr-labeled controls (B12-8D3). Autoradiography of [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3 and [125I]I-Adu-8D3 showed an amyloid-beta related granular uptake pattern of radioactivity. In contrast, the [89Zr]Zr-DFO-conjugates and the control antibody groups did not show any amyloid-beta related uptake pattern, indicating that DFO is inferior for 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging of the brain in comparison to DFO* for Adu-8D3. This was confirmed by day 7 PET images showing only amyloid-beta related brain uptake for [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-NCS-Adu-8D3. In wild type animals, such an uptake was not observed. Immunostaining showed a co-localization of all administered Adu-8D3 conjugates with amyloid-beta plaques. Conclusion: We successfully demonstrated that 89Zr-immuno-PET is suitable for imaging and quantifying amyloid-beta specific brain uptake using a bispecific aducanumab brain shuttling antibody, Adu-8D3, but only when using the novel chelator DFO*, and not DFO, for labeling with 89Zr.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36276649": {"ArticleTitle": "A sporadic Alzheimer's blood-brain barrier model for developing ultrasound-mediated delivery of Aducanumab and anti-Tau antibodies.", "AbstractText": "Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major impediment to therapeutic intracranial drug delivery for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focused ultrasound applied together with microbubbles (FUS+MB) is a novel technique to transiently open the BBB and increase drug delivery. Evidence suggests that FUS+MB is safe, however, the effects of FUS+MB on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated. In addition, there currently are no cell platforms to test for FUS+MB-mediated drug delivery. Methods: Here we generated BBB cells (induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) and astrocytes (iAstrocytes)) from apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We established mono- and co-culture models of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells to investigate the effects of FUS+MB on BBB cell phenotype and to screen for the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies, an Aducanumab-analogue (AduhelmTM; anti-amyloid-&#946;) and a novel anti-Tau antibody, RNF5. We then developed a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model as a step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS+MB drug delivery platform. Results: When compared to untreated cells, the delivery of Aducanumab-analogue and RNF5 was significantly increased (up to 1.73 fold), across the Transwell-based BBB models following FUS+MB treatment. Our results also demonstrated the safety of FUS+MB indicated by minimal changes in iBEC transcriptome as well as little or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the first 24 h post FUS+MB. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful iBEC barrier formation in our novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model with significantly increased delivery (1.4 fold) of Aducanumab-analogue following FUS+MB.

Hearing loss is one of the modifiable risk factors for dementia, with approximately 4 million of the 50 million cases of dementia worldwide possibly attributed to untreated HL. This paper describes four possible mechanisms that have been suggested for the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia. The first mechanism suggests mitochondrial dysfunction and altered signal pathways due to aging as a possible link between ARHL and AD. The second mechanism proposes that sensory degradation in hearing impaired people could explain the relationship between ARHL and AD. The occupation of cognitive resource (third) mechanism indicates that the association between ARHL and AD is a result of increased cognitive processing that is required to compensate for the degraded sensory input. The fourth mechanism is an expansion of the third mechanism, i.e., the function and structure interaction involves both cognitive resource occupation (neural activity) and AD pathology as the link between ARHL and AD. Exploring the specific mechanisms that provide the link between ARHL and AD has the potential to lead to innovative ideas for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of AD.

The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD.

Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function. However, the efficacy of tetrandrine and the associated therapeutic mechanism in tauopathies have not been evaluated and elucidated.Novel object recognition, fear conditioning and electrophysiology were used to evaluate the effects of tetrandrine on memory functions in transgenic tau mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were employed to determine the effect of tetrandrine on autophagy and tau clearance in vivo. Calcium (Ca2+) imaging and flow cytometry were used to delineate the role of pathological tau and tetrandrine in lysosomal Ca2+ and pH homeostasis. Biochemical BiFC fluorescence, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas coculture of brain slices with isolated microglia was used to evaluate tau clearance ex vivo.We observed that tetrandrine treatment mitigated tau tangle development and corrected memory impairment in Thy1-hTau.P301S transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we showed that mutant tau expression disrupts lysosome pH by increasing two-pore channel 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release, thereby contributing to lysosome alkalinization. Tetrandrine inhibits TPC2, thereby restoring the lysosomal pH, promotes tau degradation via autophagy, and ameliorates tau aggregation. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, we demonstrated that tetrandrine treatment promotes pathological tau clearance by microglia.Together, these findings suggest that pathological tau disturbs endolysosomal homeostasis to impair tau clearance. This impairment results in a vicious cycle that accelerates disease pathogenesis. The success of tetrandrine in reducing tau aggregation suggests first, that tetrandrine could be an effective drug for tauopathies and second, that rescuing lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis, thereby restoring ALP function, could be an effective general strategy for the development of novel therapies for tauopathies.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36272585": {"ArticleTitle": "Soluble TREM2 and Alzheimer-related biomarker trajectories in the blood of patients with diabetes based on their cognitive status.", "AbstractText": "We aimed to elucidate the dynamics of blood biomarkers according to the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to identify useful biomarkers for diabetes-related dementia.This was a cross-sectional, nested case-control study of 121 Japanese DM and non-DM patients with different levels of cognitive functioning.

While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A&#946;.

Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A&#946; mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A&#946; species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy. AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A&#946;42 at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms. High concentration and occupancies of site-specific phosphorylation pT181 (~&#8201;22 %) and pT217 (~&#8201;16 %) (key biomarkers of AD) along with other PTMs in the PRR and MTBR indicated a regional susceptibility of PTMs in aggregated tau.

What should the elderly and people with dementia do and how the society should accommodate these special groups have aroused heated discussions in the society. The goal of the medical-nursing integration model is to realize the integrated model of medical care-nursing-rehabilitation-old care, and to better satisfy the needs by providing medical services, rehabilitation care, and health management. The medical needs of the elderly can help the elderly maintain a healthy state; the elderly care needs can be better met through elderly care services, and the burden on families and society can be reduced. With the advancement of the medical-care integration model, new solutions have been provided for the management of senile dementia patients. Therefore, under the medical-care integration model, this paper managed Alzheimer's patients based on the big data algorithm based on association rules and compared it with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, and drew the following conclusions: compared with the management satisfaction of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, family members and patients' total satisfaction with nursing management under the medical-care integration model was greatly improved; compared with the management of Alzheimer's patients under the traditional model, the incidence of adverse events in the management of Alzheimer's patients under the medical-care integration model was greatly reduced, which was reduced to 17.6%; under the medical-care integration model, the anxiety and depression scores of the elderly patients with dementia decreased rapidly; under the medical-care integration model, the living ability of senile dementia patients has been greatly improved; the use of the medical-care integration model to manage senile dementia patients has greatly improved the sleep quality, mental quality, and quality of life of senile dementia patients.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36267702": {"ArticleTitle": "Role of mitophagy in the neurodegenerative diseases and its pharmacological advances: A review.", "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable and debilitating diseases characterized by progressive degeneration and death of cells in the central nervous system.

We performed a direct comparison of the FMM-FBB rdcCL method using MRI and CT images to define a common target region and the six regional VOIs of frontal, temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, occipital, and striatal regions. Global and regional rdcCL scales were compared between MRI-based and CT-based methods. For clinical validation, the cohort consisted of 2245 subjects (627 CN, 933 MCI, and 685 ADD).Both MRI-based and CT-based rdcCL scales showed that FMM and FBB were highly correlated with each other, globally and regionally (R2 = 0.96~0.99). Both FMM and FBB showed that CT-based rdcCL scales were highly correlated with MRI-based rdcCL scales (R2 = 0.97~0.99). Regarding the absolute difference of rdcCLs between FMM and FBB, the CT-based method was not different from the MRI-based method, globally or regionally (p value = 0.07~0.95). In our clinical validation study, the global negative group showed that the regional positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the regional negative subgroup (p < 0.05). The global positive group also showed that the striatal positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the striatal negative subgroup (p < 0.05).Our findings suggest that it is feasible to convert regional FMM or FBB rdcSUVR values into rdcCL scales without additional MRI scans.

The risk of NHA was calculated using a competing risk analysis.Over the follow-up period (median 5.29&#8201;years), 226 individuals were admitted to a NH and 268 died without admission to a NH. The overall cumulative risk of NHA was 1.4, 5.7 and 13.1% at respectively 1&#8201;year, 3&#8201;years and end of follow-up period. After multivariable adjustment, higher age, low educational attainment, living alone and use of home care services were significantly associated with a higher risk of NHA. A number of need factors (e.g., history of falls, suffering from urinary incontinence, depression or Alzheimer's disease) were also significantly associated with a higher risk of NHA.

Perceived health and limitations were both significant determinants of NHA, but perceived health was an effect modifier on limitations and vice versa.Our findings pinpoint important predictors of NHA in older adults, and offer possibilities of prevention to avoid or delay NHA for this population. Practical implications include prevention of falls, management of urinary incontinence at home and appropriate and timely management of limitations, depression and Alzheimer's disease.

However, semi-quantitative measures may potentially be affected by changes in blood flow, whereas quantitative measures such as binding potential (BPND) are not. For [18F]flortaucipir PET the sensitivity of SUVr for changes in blood flow has not been investigated yet. This is important, because [18F]flortaucipir PET is an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore we compared semi-quantitative (SUVr) and quantitative (R1, BPND) parameters of longitudinal [18F]flortaucipir PET scans, and assessed their vulnerability to changes in blood flow. Subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n = 24) underwent baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU) dynamic [18F]flortaucipir PET scans. BPND and R1 were estimated using receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and SUVr(80-100min) was calculated. For each region-of-interest ((trans)entorhinal, limbic and neocortical) and parameter, %change was calculated. Regional SUVrs were compared to corresponding DVR (= BPND+1) using paired T-tests. Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change. R1 changes were small (+0.7% in SCD and -1.6% in AD). Simulations illustrated a variable %bias for SUVr depending on the underlying binding condition. Concluding, in line with established practices, SUVr provided an accurate estimate of specific binding for [18F]flortaucipir over a two-year follow-up during which changes in flow were small, also in AD patients. Notwithstanding, simulations showed that large(r) flow changes may potentially affect [18F]flortaucipir SUVr. Given that it is currently unknown to what order of magnitude pharmacotherapeutic interventions may induce changes in cerebral blood flow, caution may be warranted in situations where changes in flow are large(r) and DVR/BPND may be preferred in such conditions to ensure representative quantification of [18F]flortaucipir PET images.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36265268": {"ArticleTitle": "Guanidine-based &#946; amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors for the Alzheimer's disease (AD): A review.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder characterized by amyloid plaques, hyperphosphorylated tau protein (hyper p-tau), neuronal damage, memory loss, etc. Various factors, such as age, lifestyle, family history, environmental factors, and gene mutation, cause AD.

However, such studies have also produced conflicting results. A new mtDNA association model, the 'variant load model' (VLM), has been applied to multiple disease phenotypes. Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores.

TBI events were classified by age at injury (TBI <25 or &#8805;25 years) and TBI severity (loss of consciousness, multiple events). Cognitive composite scores were calculated from results of a neuropsychological test battery. NPSs were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q).

Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline.

A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed.

Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (P < 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (P < 0.0001).

Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2&#945; and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2&#945; without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2&#945; and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent.

We searched in PubMed, BVS, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, using the keywords: Alzheimer's disease, optical coherence tomography, white matter, cortex, atrophy, cortical thickness, neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. We included articles that studied the retina in relation to neuroimaging in patients with AD, MCI, and preclinical AD. We excluded studies without OCT, without neuroimaging, clinical cases, opinion articles, systematic reviews, and animal studies.Of a total of 35 articles found, 23 were finally included. Although mixed results were found, most of these corroborate the relationship between retinal and brain disorders.More rigorous research is needed in the field, including homogenized, longitudinal, and prolonged follow-up studies, as well as studies that include all stages of AD.

Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC).

In the more challenging task of detecting MCI, it achieves an AUC of 62.45. It is also significantly faster than the volume/thickness model in which the volumes and thickness need to be extracted beforehand. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimer's disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals.

Concentrations were compared between groups using a linear regression model adjusting for age and sex, with 95% bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals. Concentrations in each group were correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score using non-parametric partial correlations adjusting for age. Age-adjusted z-scores were also created for the concentration of markers in each participant, investigating how many had a value above the 95th percentile of controls.Only chitotriosidase in symptomatic GRN mutation carriers had a concentration significantly higher than controls. No group had higher TREM2 or YKL-40 concentrations than controls after adjusting for age and sex. There was a significant negative correlation of chitotriosidase concentration with MMSE in presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. In the symptomatic groups, for TREM2 31% of C9orf72, 25% of GRN, and 14% of MAPT mutation carriers had a concentration above the 95th percentile of controls. For YKL-40 this was 8% C9orf72, 8% GRN and 0% MAPT mutation carriers, whilst for chitotriosidase it was 23% C9orf72, 50% GRN, and 29% MAPT mutation carriers.Although chitotriosidase concentrations in GRN mutation carriers were the only significantly raised glia-derived biomarker as a group, a subset of mutation carriers in all three groups, particularly for chitotriosidase and TREM2, had elevated concentrations.

In contrast to A&#946;, abnormally phosphorylated &#964; (p-&#964;) can also be found in non-AD tauopathies. In AD, p-&#964; is the main component of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which result from aggregation of abnormally phosphorylated and folded &#964;. In this review, we discuss the role of p-&#964; pathology in Alzheimer's disease considering neuropathological, biochemical, cellular, animal model, and clinical findings. We discuss the relationship between p-&#964; and other AD-related proteins such as A&#946; and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). In light of the current state of knowledge, we conclude that p-&#964; aggregation known as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) may represent a prerequisite for the development of AD rather that a downstream effect of A&#946; toxicity. However, A&#946; as well as TDP-43 pathology appear to accelerate accumulation and propagation of p-&#964; pathology once initiated, ultimately leading to the full-blown picture of AD. In this context, &#964; seeds can induce granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), AD-typical lesions in which the activated necrosome - required for the execution of necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death - can be found. Moreover, necrosome-exhibiting GVD is associated with a decreased neuronal density. Thus, we speculate that p-&#964; pathology is a major driver for neuron loss in AD via GVD-mediated necroptosis. Overall, p-&#964; seems to play a central role in AD as it appears to constitute a prerequisite for AD development which can then be accelerated by co-factors.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping data were acquired and used to quantify regional magnetic susceptibility, and the resulting spatial standard deviations were recorded. A general linear model was applied to perform the inter-group comparison. As a result, relative to young adults, old adults showed significantly higher iron deposition with higher spatial variation in all of the subcortical nuclei (p&#160;<&#160;0.01). pPD showed a high spatial variation of iron distribution in the subcortical nuclei except for substantia nigra (SN); and iron deposition in SN and red nucleus (RN) were progressively increased from pPD to cPD (p&#160;<&#160;0.01).

However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF1&#945;).

In addition, we analyze the main issues regarding the neuroprotective and neurotoxic role of neuroglial changes, reactions and/or involutions in both humans with Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models of this condition.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36238082": {"ArticleTitle": "SARS-CoV-2, long COVID, prion disease and neurodegeneration.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36236757": {"ArticleTitle": "Voting Ensemble Approach for Enhancing Alzheimer's Disease Classification.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is dementia that impairs one's thinking, behavior, and memory. It starts as a moderate condition affecting areas of the brain that make it challenging to retain recently learned information, causes mood swings, and causes confusion regarding occasions, times, and locations. The most prevalent type of dementia, called Alzheimer's disease (AD), causes memory-related problems in patients. A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. For the binary classification of with dementia and no dementia, an accuracy of 96.4% and an AUC of 97.2% is attained.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36235786": {"ArticleTitle": "Treadmill Exercise Modulates Intestinal Microbes and Suppresses LPS Displacement to Alleviate Neuroinflammation in the Brains of APP/PS1 Mice.", "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation occurs throughout the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice were subjected to 12 weeks of treadmill exercise, followed by spatial memory tests.

We found that this strategy of exercise enriched gut microbial diversity and alleviated neuroinflammation in the brain. Notably, exercise led to reductions in pathogenic bacteria such as intestinal Allobaculum, increases in probiotic bacteria such as Akkermansia, increased levels of intestine-brain barrier proteins, and attenuated LPS displacement. These results suggest that prolonged exercise can effectively modulate gut microbes and the intestinal barrier and thereby reduce LPS displacement and ultimately alleviate AD-related neuroinflammation.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36235754": {"ArticleTitle": "The Potential Neuroprotective Effects of Extracts from Oat Seedlings against Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "The physiological or dietary advantages of germinated grains have been the subject of numerous discussions over the past decade. Around 23 million tons of oats are consumed globally, making up a sizeable portion of the global grain market. Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A&#946;) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (w/v), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 &#176;C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis. The results indicated that the treatment with OSE protects against A&#946;25-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells. Tg-5Xfad AD mice had strong deposition of A&#946; throughout their brains, while WT mice did not exhibit any such deposition within their brains. A drastic reduction was observed in terms of numbers, as well as the size, of A&#946; plaques within Tg-5Xfad AD mice exposed to OSE. This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains. Furthermore, the study indicated that OSE treatment affects JNK/ERK/p38 MAPK signaling, with considerable inhibition in p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK levels seen in the brain of OSE-treated Tg-5Xfad AD mice.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36235622": {"ArticleTitle": "Does the Gut Microbial Metabolome Really Matter?

As isoquinoline alkaloids include galanthamine, an approved drug for Alzheimer's disease, as well as some potentially useful compounds with cytostatic potential, 28 members from this category of alkaloids were selected for a complex screening of interactions with iron and copper at four pathophysiologically relevant pH and in non-buffered conditions (dimethyl sulfoxide) by spectrophotometric methods in vitro. With the exception of the salts, all the alkaloids were able to chelate ferrous and ferric ions in non-buffered conditions, but only five of them (galanthine, glaucine, corydine, corydaline and tetrahydropalmatine) evoked some significant chelation at pH 7.5 and only the first two were also active at pH 6.8. By contrast, none of the tested alkaloids chelated cuprous or cupric ions. All the alkaloids, with the exception of the protopines, significantly reduced the ferric and cupric ions, with stronger effects on the latter. These effects were mostly dependent on the number of free aromatic hydroxyls, but not other hydroxyl groups. The most potent reductant was boldine. As most of the alkaloids chelated and reduced the ferric ions, additional experimental studies are needed to elucidate the biological relevance of these results, as chelation is expected to block reactive oxygen species formation, while reduction could have the opposite effect.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36234916": {"ArticleTitle": "Resveratrol-Maltol and Resveratrol-Thiophene Hybrids as Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Antioxidants: Synthesis, Biometal Chelating Capability and Crystal Structure.", "AbstractText": "New resveratrol-thiophene and resveratrol-maltol hybrids were synthesized as cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants.

The presence of both cis and trans isomers in lobeline is well known, and many studies on the relationship between the structure and pharmacological activity of lobeline and its analogs have been reported. However, it is a remarkable fact that no studies have reported the differences in pharmacological activities between the two isomers. In this article, we found that different degrees of isomerization of lobeline injection have significant differences in respiratory excitatory effects in pentobarbital sodium anesthetized rats.

A&#946; peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1. However, this is precluded by cleavage of APP by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase, ADAM10. Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels. Furthermore, decreases in SIRT1 protein levels were observed at an earlier time point than the decreases in ADAM10 protein levels, and the reduction in SIRT1 was reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132.

Exposure was the cumulative days of antibiotic prescription from 2002 to 2005. Newly diagnosed overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) were identified based on diagnostic codes and prescriptions for dementia-related drugs.

While the majority (>&#8201;90%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92-100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59-64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1-101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., A&#946; plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al.

This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms.

Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al.

To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes.

We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression. We found that music evokes AMs in these disorders, and that familiar music was more likely to evoke AMs. Compared with healthy controls, AD participants had a relative advantage for MEAMs over picture-evoked AMs. People with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex showed preserved access to MEAMs in terms of frequency, but a relative disadvantage regarding the episodic richness for MEAMs, but not for memories cued by pictures, compared to controls. Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music.

However, confirmatory studies are required to demonstrate their usefulness in the clinical setting.We evaluated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from consecutive patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (n = 59), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 31), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (n = 29), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 49), Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 97), and suspected non-AD physiopathology (n = 51), as well as plasma samples from 60 healthy controls (HC). We measured neurofilament light chain (NfL), phospho-tau181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) using Simoa (all plasma biomarkers and CSF GFAP), CLEIA (CSF p-tau181), and ELISA (CSF NfL) assays. Additionally, we stratified patients according to the A/T/N classification scheme and the CSF &#945;-synuclein real-time quaking-induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC) results.We found good correlations between CSF and plasma biomarkers for NfL (rho = 0.668, p < 0.001) and p-tau181 (rho = 0.619, p < 0.001). Plasma NfL was significantly higher in disease groups than in HC and showed a greater increase in FTD than in AD [44.9 (28.1-68.6) vs. 21.9 (17.0-27.9) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. Conversely, plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels were significantly higher in AD than in FTD [3.2 (2.4-4.3) vs. 1.1 (0.7-1.6) pg/ml, p < 0.001; 404.7 (279.7-503.0) vs. 198.2 (143.9-316.8) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. GFAP also allowed discriminating disease groups from HC. In the distinction between FTD and AD, plasma p-tau181 showed better accuracy (AUC 0.964) than NfL (AUC 0.791) and GFAP (AUC 0.818). In DLB and CBS, CSF amyloid positive (A+) subjects had higher plasma p-tau181 and GFAP levels than A- individuals. CSF RT-QuIC showed positive &#945;-synuclein seeding activity in 96% DLB and 15% AD patients with no differences in plasma biomarker levels in those stratified by RT-QuIC result.In a single-center clinical cohort, we confirm the high diagnostic value of plasma p-tau181 for distinguishing FTD from AD and plasma NfL for discriminating degenerative dementias from HC. Plasma GFAP alone differentiates AD from FTD and neurodegenerative dementias from HC but with lower accuracy than p-tau181 and NfL.

Moreover, RB (10-30&#160;mg/kg, i.p.) effectively attenuated cognitive impairments induced by A&#946; oligomers in mice.

Molecular docking analysis suggested that RB might directly interact with GSK3&#946; and CDK5 by acting on ATP binding sites. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that RB might act on protein phosphorylation pathways to inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation.RB was shown to inhibit tau neurotoxicity at least partially via inhibiting the activity of GSK3&#946; and CDK5, which is a novel neuroprotective mechanism besides the inhibition of tau aggregation.

We hypothesized that this relationship is compromised in APOE4 mice considering the differences in fatty acid metabolism between APOE3 and APOE4 mice.

During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A&#946;) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD.This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD.

AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained.

Our multi-omics approach is based on (a) 2114 human post-mortem brain transcriptomics to identify differentially expressed genes; (b) in silico metabolic flux analysis on context-specific metabolic networks identified differential reaction fluxes; (c) multimodal neuroimaging analysis on 1576 participants to associate genetic variants in sphingomyelin pathway with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis; (d) plasma metabolomic and lipidomic analysis to identify associations of lipid species with dysregulation in Alzheimer's; and (e) metabolite genome-wide association studies to define receptors within the pathway as a potential drug target. We validate our hypothesis in amyloidogenic APP/PS1 mice and show prolonged exposure to fingolimod&#160;alleviated synaptic plasticity and cognitive impairment in mice.

Aged (23.27 mo &#177; 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to APOE genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only APOE4/4 females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that APOE4, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD. Last, there was a very high degree of variability in behavioral performance across APOE genotypes. A cluster analysis of the behavioral data revealed a low-activity and a high-activity cluster.

Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial. Factors related to drug availability may influence response; in particular, low serum albumin (for donepezil), CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug doses are the most consistent predictors, while AChEI concentration influence on clinical outcomes is debatable. Other predictors of response include faster disease progression, lower serum cholesterol, preserved medial temporal lobes, apathy, absence of concomitant diseases, and absence of antipsychotics.

Funnel plots, sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were performed to test publication bias and result stability. In addition, an explanation for the heterogeneity of the results was suggested.In total, 20 articles were selected for review; 18 included results on the long-term effects of PM2.5 on dementia, 13 on AD, and eight on VaD.

Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the &#223;2-adrenergic receptor (&#223;2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; &#223;2-agAAb) and is linked to an elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the &#223;2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against &#223;2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (A&#223;) monomers were tested (A&#223;1-14, A&#223;10-25, A&#946;10-37 A&#223;1-40, A&#223;1-42, A&#946;28-40, and A&#223;-[Pyr]3-43).

Contrary, long-chain A&#223;-[Pyr]3-43, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that after blocking by the &#223;2-AR antagonist ICI118.551, could be identified as that the effect was realized via the &#223;2-AR. Moreover, the long chain A&#223;1-40, A&#946;1-42, and A&#946;10-37, yet not the short-chain A&#223; peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the &#223;2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the &#223;2-AR, like the &#223;2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the &#223;2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36201209": {"ArticleTitle": "Association of Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Alzheimer Disease Biomarkers With Race and the Role of Genetic Ancestry, Vascular Comorbidities, and Neighborhood Factors.", "AbstractText": "Differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau Alzheimer dementia (AD) biomarkers by self-identified race have been observed in prior studies.

No methods are currently available for visualizing cholesterol metabolism in the living human brain; therefore, a noninvasive technology that quantitatively measures the extent of brain cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 could broadly affect disease diagnosis and treatment options using targeted therapies. Here, we describe the development and testing of a CYP46A1-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, 18F-CHL-2205 (18F-Cholestify). Our data show that PET imaging readouts correlate with CYP46A1 protein expression and with the extent to which cholesterol is metabolized in the brain, as assessed by cross-species postmortem analyses of specimens from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Proof of concept of in vivo efficacy is provided in the well-established 3xTg-AD murine model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where we show that the probe is sensitive to differences in brain cholesterol metabolism between 3xTg-AD mice and control animals. Furthermore, our clinical observations point toward a considerably higher baseline brain cholesterol clearance via CYP46A1 in women, as compared to age-matched men.

The results including catalase (CAT), glutathione S transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) demonstrated that ZOMEC significantly reverted the oxidative stress stimulated by PTZ in the mouse brain. ZOMEC upregulated p-Akt/Nrf-2 pathways (also supported by molecular docking methods) to revoke PTZ-induced apoptotic protein markers. ZOMEC reversed PTZ-induced neuronal synapse deficits, improved oxidative stress-aided memory impairment, and inhibited the amyloidogenic pathway in mouse brains.

Saffron is a traditional medicinal plant used as a food additive. The stigma of saffron has bioactive compounds such as safranal, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, kaempferol, and flavonoid. These bioactive compounds can be extracted using conventional (maceration, solvent extraction, soxhlet extraction, and vapor or hydrodistillation) and novel techniques (emulsion liquid membrane extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-associated extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and supercritical fluid extraction). Saffron is used as a functional ingredient, natural colorant, shelf-life enhancer, and fortifying agent in developing different food products. The demand for saffron has been increasing in the pharma industry due to its protection against cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidepressant properties.

We used the EfficientNet-b2 network as the backbone of the model to extract features from the images. Integrated features from four retinal photographs (optic nerve head-centred and macula-centred fields from both eyes) for each individual were used to develop supervised deep learning models and equip the network with unsupervised domain adaptation technique, to address dataset discrepancy between the different studies.

However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with \"AD-type\" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P&#160;<&#160;0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants. A smaller cohort of non-European subjects (n&#160;=&#160;273, approximately one-half of whom were African-Americans) provided the basis for additional exploratory analyses.

Conversely, PQR530 which exhibits better brain exposure and superior pharmacokinetic properties, reduced tau pathology even when the treatment started after the onset of pathology. Our results show that dosing animals twice per week with PQR530 resulted in intermittent, rather than sustained target engagement. Nevertheless, this pulse-like mTOR inhibition followed by longer intervals of re-activation was sufficient to reduce tau pathology in the cerebral cortex in P301S tau transgenic mice.

The purpose of this Mini-Forum is to provide a solutions-based discussion of the ethical and legal gaps and practical questions about how to use and communicate these data. Investigators often use DRE in research. When participants ask for their personal results, investigators have concerns. Will data that was intended to study groups be valid for individuals? Will sharing data cause distress? Debates around sharing DRE became heated when blood-based amyloid tests and amyloid reducing drugs appeared poised to enable clinicians easily to identify people with elevated brain amyloid and reduce it with a drug. Such an approach would transform the traditional role of DRE from investigational to foundational; however, then the high costs, uncertain clinical benefits and risks of the therapy led to an urgent need for education to support clinical decision making. Further complicating DRE use are direct to consumer genetic testing and increasingly available biomarker testing. Withholding DRE becomes less feasible and public education around responsible use and understanding become vital. A critical answer to these legal and ethical issues is supporting education that clearly delineates known risks, benefits, and gaps in knowledge, and communication to promote understanding among researchers, clinicians, patients, and all stakeholders.

Data from other centers is lacking, so here we analyzed safety and pilot real-world short-term results of TPS from the first center in Germany. To gain information about effects in different stages, patients with not only mild but also moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's were analyzed.A total of 11 patients were retrospectively examined for cognitive and emotional function before and after the first stimulation series. The effect was assessed using several neuropsychological tests [Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), including the ADAS cognitive score (ADAS Cog) and ADAS affective scores, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] including in comparison between the groups of mild-to-severe patients. Moreover, subjective improvement of symptom severity, potential effects on depressive symptoms, and side effects were analyzed using Numeric Rating Scales (NRS).Side effects were rare (in 4% of sessions) with moderate subjective severity and only transient. Patients significantly improved in the ADAS and ADAS Cog, while there was no significant effect in MMSE and MoCA. Patients' self-reported symptom severity improved significantly. The depressive symptoms measured in an ADAS subscale also improved significantly. Statistical data analyses revealed no significant correlation of clinical improvement with baseline symptom severity.TPS might be a safe and promising add-on therapy for Alzheimer's, even for moderate-to-severe patients. More research on long-term effects in patients as well as studies with sham control groups is needed.

We implemented a data-driven strategy to identify predictors from 366 candidate variables covering a comprehensive range of genetic and environmental factors and developed the ML model to predict incident dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) within five, ten, and much longer years (median 11.9 [Interquartile range 11.2-12.5] years).During a follow-up of 5,023,337 person-years, 5287 and 2416 participants developed dementia and AD, respectively. A novel UKB dementia risk prediction (UKB-DRP) model comprising ten predictors including age, ApoE &#949;4, pairs matching time, leg fat percentage, number of medications taken, reaction time, peak expiratory flow, mother's age at death, long-standing illness, and mean corpuscular volume was established. Our prediction model was internally evaluated based on five-fold cross-validation on discrimination and calibration, and it was further compared with existing prediction scales. The UKB-DRP model can achieve high discriminative accuracy in dementia (AUC 0.848 &#177; 0.007) and even better in AD (AUC 0.862 &#177; 0.015). The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value&#160;=&#160;0.92), and the predictive power was solid in different incidence time groups.

The model was internally validated in the general population of European ancestry and White ethnicity; thus, further validation with independent datasets is necessary to confirm these findings.Our ML-based UKB-DRP model incorporated ten easily accessible predictors with solid predictive power for incident dementia and AD within five, ten, and much longer years, which can be used to identify individuals at high risk of dementia and AD in the general population.This study was funded by grants from the Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Major Projects (2022ZD0211600), National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1312904, 2019YFA070950), National Natural Science Foundation of China (282071201, 81971032, 82071997), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2018SHZDZX01), Research Start-up Fund of Huashan Hospital (2022QD002), Excellence 2025 Talent Cultivation Program at Fudan University (3030277001), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (21QA1408700), Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2021-013), and the 111 Project (No. B18015).", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36187613": {"ArticleTitle": "The positive aspects of caregiving in dementia: A scoping review and bibliometric analysis.", "AbstractText": "The increasing incidence of dementia and home-based care exposes family caregivers to a variety of challenges as they endure strong stressors underlying the caregiver role.

Specifically, we hypothesized that older cognitive healthy participants would exhibit comparable performance when the task was explicit and relied on conscious cognition. However, when the task was implicit, the performance of participants at high and low risks for AD would bifurcate. That is, early changes in unconscious cognition could be linked to cognitive health.We measured implicit interference elicited by an imperceptible distractor in cognitively healthy elderly participants with normal (low risk) and pathological (high risk) A&#946;42/total tau ratio.

The neuroprotective effects of berberine and Berberis vulgaris (barberry) root extract against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the human SH-SY5Y cell line were studied.The methanolic extraction of barberry root was performed using a maceration procedure. Oxidative stress was induced in SH-SY5Y cells by H2O2, and an MTT assay was applied to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of berberine and barberry root extract. The cells were pretreated with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each compound (including berberine, barberry root extract, and H2O2), and the anti-apoptotic effects of all components were investigated using RT-PCR.The SH-SY5Y cell viability increased in both groups exposed to 75 and 150 ppm barberry extract compared with that in the H2O2-treated group. The data showed that exposing SH-SY5Y cells to 30 ppm berberine significantly increased the cell viability compared with the H2O2-treated group; treatment with 150 and 300 ppm berberine and H2O2 significantly decreased the SH-SY5Y cell viability and was associated with berberine cytotoxicity. The mRNA levels of Bax decreased significantly under treatment with berberine at 30 ppm compared with the control group. A significant increase in Bcl-2 expression was observed only after treatment with the IC50 of berberine. The expression level of Bcl-2 in cells exposed to both berberine and barberry extracts was also significantly higher than that in cells exposed to H2O2.The outcomes of this study suggest that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with barberry extract and berberine could suppress apoptosis by regulating the actions of Bcl-2 family members.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36185994": {"ArticleTitle": "Erratum.", "AbstractText": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1002/trc2.12331.].", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36185993": {"ArticleTitle": "Chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2: Protocol and methods from the Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium.", "AbstractText": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused >3.5 million deaths worldwide and affected >160 million people. At least twice as many have been infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. We focus on risk factors and possible molecular, inflammatory, and viral mechanisms underlying neurological injury. We also provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers and institutions.Successful harmonization of designs and methods was achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.The Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and AD and related dementias (ADRD)The primary objective of this large-scale collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a \"green paper\" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae.

Furthermore, the biochemical analysis showed that HA-MMSN-1F12 did not detect any toxic side effects on the liver and kidney. Thus, the efficacy of HA-MMSN-1F12 is associated with the targeted degradation of insoluble brain A&#946; plaques, avoidance of non-specific hepatic uptake, and excretion of peripheral A&#946; through intestinal metabolism.

Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients.

The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds.

Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively.

At present, preclinical AD is identified mainly in research settings, though consensus criteria for a clinical diagnosis may soon be established. There is not yet adequate legal protection for the growing number of individuals with preclinical AD. Some PHI generated in preclinical AD trials has clinical significance, necessitating urgent evaluations and longitudinal monitoring in care settings. AD researchers are obligated to both respect the confidentiality of participants' sensitive PHI and facilitate providers' access to necessary information, often requiring disclosure of preclinical AD status. The AD research community must continue to develop ethical, participant-centered practices related to confidentiality and disclosure, with attention to sensitive information in the EHR. These practices will be essential for translation into the clinic, and across health systems and society at large.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36179926": {"ArticleTitle": "Phyto-therapeutic and nanomedicinal approaches: A new hope for management of Alzheimer's disease.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36179555": {"ArticleTitle": "Can we really 'read' art to see the changing brain?

Authors argue that these cases may provide a unique body of evidence, so-called 'artistic signatures' of neurodegenerative diseases, that might be used to understand disorders, provide diagnoses, be employed in treatment, create patterns of testable hypotheses for causative study, and also provide unique insight into the neurobiological linkages between the mind, brain, body, and the human penchant for art-making itself. However-before we can begin to meaningfully build from such emerging findings, much less formulate applications-not only is such evidence currently quite disparate and in need of systematic review, almost all case reports and artwork ratings are entirely subjective, based on authors' personal observations or a sparse collection of methods that may not best fit underlying research aims. This leads to the very real question of whether we might actually find patterns of systematic change if fit to a rigorous review-Can we really 'read' art to illuminate possible changes in the brain? How might we best approach this topic in future neuroscientific, clinical, and art-related research? This paper presents a review of this field and answer to these questions. We consider the current case reports for seven main disorders-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, aphasia, as well as stroke-consolidating arguments for factors and changes related to art-making and critiquing past methods. Taking the published artworks from these papers, we then conduct our own assessment, employing computerized and human-rater-based approaches, which we argue represent best practice to identify stylistic or creativity/quality changes. We suggest, indeed, some evidence for systematic patterns in art-making for specific disorders and also find that case authors showed rather high agreement with our own assessments. More important, through opening this topic and past evidence to a systematic review, we hope to open a discussion and provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future application and research on the intersection of art-making and the neurotypical, the changed, and the artistic brain.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36179535": {"ArticleTitle": "Increment of CSF fractalkine-positive microvesicles preceded the spatial memory impairment in amyloid beta neurotoxicity.", "AbstractText": "Fractalkine (CX3CL1) is a key chemokine, affects neuronal cell communication and involves in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

A&#946;42 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A&#946;42 exhibit well-defined, cross &#946;-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A&#946;42 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A&#946;42 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A&#946;42 monomer at lower pH can adopt an &#945;-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to &#946;-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of &#945;-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in &#945;-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A&#946;42 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with &#945;-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide. Although random coil conformations were found to be the most dominant, as expected, &#945;-helical conformations are thermodynamically accessible, more so than &#946;-sheet conformations. Importantly, for the first time &#945;-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation.

DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify.Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections. MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET features.

The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a visual assessment method that provides both an overall assessment of brain tauopathy and regional characterization of abnormal tau deposition. Methods: 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na&#239;ve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. Results: For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or >75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern. Readers demonstrated agreement 94% of the time for overall positivity/negativity. Concordance on the determination of the regional binary outcomes (negative or positive) showed agreement of 74.3 % and Fleiss' k of 0.912. Using clinical diagnosis as the ground truth, readers demonstrated a sensitivity of 73-79% and specificity of 91-93, with combined reader concordance sensitivity of 80% and specificity 93%.

Little is known about the extent to which targetable pathogenic mechanisms are shared among these seemingly diverse diseases. Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36170055": {"ArticleTitle": "Computationally Elucidating the Binding Kinetics for Different AChE Inhibitors to Access the Rationale for Improving the Drug Efficacy.", "AbstractText": "Traditional drug discovery is based on a binding affinity (thermodynamics)-driven paradigm. Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (koff). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between mAChE and TcAChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either TcAChE or mAChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with mAChE than TcAChE.

AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms.

A&#946; accumulation activates microglia, which secrete proinflammatory factors associated with A&#946; clearance impairment and cause neurotoxicity, generating a vicious cycle among A&#946; accumulation, activated microglia, and proinflammatory factors. Blocking this cycle can be a therapeutic strategy for AD. Using A&#946;-activated HMC3 microglial cells, we observed that isorhamnetin, a main constituent of Oenanthe javanica, reduced the A&#946;-triggered secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 6 and downregulated the expression levels of the microglial activation markers ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) and CD11b and the inflammatory marker nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B). Treatment of the SH-SY5Y-derived neuronal cells with the A&#946;-activated HMC3-conditioned medium (HMC3-conditioned medium) or IL-6 increased reactive oxygen species production, upregulated cleaved caspase 3 expression, and reduced neurite outgrowth, whereas treatment with isorhamnetin counteracted these neurodegenerative presentations. In the SH-SY5Y-derived neuronal cells, IL-6 upregulated the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), whereas isorhamnetin normalized this abnormal phosphorylation. Overexpression of TYK2 attenuated the neuroprotective effect of isorhamnetin on IL-6-induced neurotoxicity. Our findings demonstrate that isorhamnetin exerts its neuroprotective effect by mediating the neuroinflammatory IL-6/TYK2 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential for treating AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36160384": {"ArticleTitle": "Emerging trends and hot spots of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurological diseases: A bibliometric analysis.", "AbstractText": "Background: NLRP3 inflammasome has been of great interest in the field of neurological diseases. To visualize the research hotspots and evolutionary trends in this area, we collected the relevant articles in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2010 to 2022 and analyzed them using CiteSpace software. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the literature within the Web of Science Core Collection database using the strategy described below: TS = NLRP3 inflammasome AND TS = neurological diseases OR TS = neurological disorder OR TS = brain disorder OR TS = brain injury OR TS = central nervous system disease OR TS = CNS disease OR TS = central nervous system disorder OR TS = CNS disorder AND Language = English from 2010 to 2022. The type of literature was limited to articles and reviews. The data were processed using CiteSpace software (version 5.8. R3). Results: A total of 1,217 literature from 67 countries/regions and 337 research institutions was retrieved. Publications in this area have increased rapidly since 2013. China presents the highest number of published articles, but the United States has a higher centrality and h-index. The top five most published institutions and authors are from China, Zhejiang University and Li Y ranking first, respectively. Of the ten most cited articles, Prof. Heneka MT and colleagues accounted for three of them. In terms of the co-occurrence keyword diagram, the five most frequent keywords are \"nlrp3 inflammasome\", \"activation\", \"oxidative stress\", \"expression\", and \"alzheimers disease\". Conclusion: The research of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurological disorders is overall developing well. Chinese scholars contributed the most significant number of articles, while researchers from developed countries presented more influential papers. The importance of NLRP3 inflammasome in neurological diseases is widely appreciated, and the mechanism is under study.

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have explored the causal effects of IBD on PD and AD. However, only a few studies examined this reverse association. Thus, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations of genetically predicted PD and AD with IBD, using a two-sample MR study.Summary statistics for IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) were derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, which included the International IBD Genetics Consortium and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium (n=59,957). Genetic variants associated with the largest meta-analysis of GWAS of PD (n=1,474,097) and AD (n=455,258) were used as instrumental variables. We used multiple methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS) methods, to estimate the effects of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD. To confirm the validity of the analysis, we also evaluated the pleiotropic effects, heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis that drive causal associations.The results of the IVW method, WM, and RAPS showed that genetically predicted PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of UC (odds ratio [OR]IVW=1.068, OR WM=1.107, OR RAPS=1.069, all P<0.05). Additionally, we found that there were significant associations of genetically predicted PD with CD (OR IVW=1.064, OR RAPS=1.065, all P<0.05) and IBD (OR IVW=1.062, OR RAPS=1.063, all P<0.05) using the IVW method and RAPS. However, there was no significant causal evidence of genetically predicted AD in IBD, UC, or CD among all MR methods. In all MR analyses, there were no horizontal pleiotropy (all P>0.05), or statistical heterogeneity. The sensitivity analysis results of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed that the causal effect estimations of genetically predicted PD and AD on IBD were robust.Our MR study corroborated a causal association between genetically predicted PD and IBD but did not support a causal effect of genetically predicted AD on IBD.

Five hub immune-related differentially expressed genes (NFKBIA, CD4, RELA, CASP3, and HSP90AA1) were screened by the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Their expression levels were significantly correlated with infiltration score and the abundance of monocytes, natural killer cells, Th2 T cells, T follicular helper cells, and cytotoxic T cells. After validation with independent datasets derived from peripheral blood and brain, RELA and HSP90AA1 were identified as two reliable immune hub genes in MCI patients and had consistent changes in AD.

Firstly, a three-dimensional (3D) visuospatial memory task is designed to provide participants with visual stimuli while their eye-movement data are recorded and used to build an eye-tracking dataset.

To fully verify the performance of the proposed model, we also design two types of models based on traditional machine-learning and typical deep-learning for comparison. Furthermore, we have also done ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each module of the proposed network.

Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions.

Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease.

However, the underlying sources of regional vulnerability to tau pathology remain unclear. Previous brain-autopsy findings suggest that the myelin levels-which differ substantially between white matter tracts in the brain-are a key modulating factor of region-specific susceptibility to tau deposition. Here, we investigated whether myelination differences between fiber tracts of the human connectome are predictive of the interregional spreading of tau pathology in AD.We included two independently recruited samples consisting of amyloid-PET-positive asymptomatic and symptomatic elderly individuals, in whom tau-PET was obtained at baseline (ADNI: n&#8201;=&#8201;275; BioFINDER-1: n&#8201;=&#8201;102) and longitudinally in a subset (ADNI: n&#8201;=&#8201;123, mean FU&#8201;=&#8201;1.53 [0.69-3.95] years; BioFINDER-1: n&#8201;=&#8201;39, mean FU&#8201;=&#8201;1.87 [1.21-2.78] years).

In&#160;a spatial regression analysis, we first tested the association between cortical myelin and group-average tau-PET signal in the amyloid-positive and control groups. Secondly, employing a previously established approach of modeling tau-PET spreading based on functional connectivity between ROIs, we estimated in&#160;a linear regression analysis, whether the level of fiber-tract myelin modulates the association between functional connectivity and longitudinal tau-PET spreading (i.e., covariance) between ROIs.We found that higher myelinated cortical regions show lower tau-PET uptake (ADNI: rho&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;-&#8201;0.267, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; BioFINDER-1: rho&#8201;=&#8201;&#8201;-&#8201;0.175, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.013).

In AD, amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) plaque-associated microglia (PAM) display a clearly distinct phenotype compared to plaque-distant microglia (PCM), suggesting that these two microglia subtypes likely differently contribute to disease progression. So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation.In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture&#160;microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia.First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches. Then, we identified, in PAM and PCM subpopulations, networks of co-deregulated genes and analyzed their potential functional roles in AD. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of microglia transcriptomic remodeling at early, intermediate and late stages of the disease&#160;and validated select findings in postmortem human AD brain.Our comprehensive study provides useful transcriptomic information regarding the respective contribution of PAM and PCM across the A&#946; pathology progression.

It demonstrates that the proximity of microglia to A&#946;-plaques dramatically alters the microglial transcriptome and reveals that these changes can have both positive and negative impacts on the surrounding cells. These opposing effects may be driven by local microglia heterogeneity also demonstrated by this study. Our approach leads to molecularly define the less well studied plaque-distant microglia. We show that plaque-distant microglia are not bystanders of the disease, although the transcriptomic changes are far less striking compared to what is observed in plaque-associated microglia.

Previous studies have used nonpolarizable force fields to study A&#946;, providing some insight into how this protein unfolds. However, nonpolarizable force fields have fixed charges that lack the ability to redistribute in response to changes in local electric fields. Here, we performed polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the full-length A&#946;42 of WT and FAD mutations and calculated folding free energies of the A&#946;15-27 fragment via umbrella sampling. By studying both the full-length A&#946;42 and a fragment containing mutations and the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17-21), we were able to systematically study how these FAD mutations impact secondary and tertiary structure and the thermodynamics of folding. Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility.

Here, we investigated whether TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; modulate the permeability of the BBB and alter A&#946; peptide transport across BECs. We used a human BBB in vitro model based on the use of brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) obtained from endothelial cells derived from CD34+ stem cells cocultivated with brain pericytes. We demonstrated that TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; differentially induced changes in BLECs' permeability by inducing alterations in the organization of junctional complexes as well as in transcelluar trafficking. Further, TNF-&#945; and IL-1&#946; act directly on BLECs by decreasing LRP1 and BCRP protein expression as well as the specific efflux of A&#946; peptide. These results provide mechanisms by which CNS inflammation might modulate BBB permeability and promote A&#946; peptide accumulation. A future therapeutic intervention targeting vascular inflammation at the BBB may have the therapeutic potential to slow down the progression of AD.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36142134": {"ArticleTitle": "The Asparaginyl Endopeptidase Legumain: An Emerging Therapeutic Target and Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is incurable dementia closely associated with aging. Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker. To advance translational research in this area, AEP imaging probes applicable to human brain and AEP inhibitors with good druggability are urgently needed.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36142042": {"ArticleTitle": "Functional Therapeutic Strategies Used in Different Stages of Alzheimer's Disease-A Systematic Review.", "AbstractText": "As Alzheimer's disease develops, the central nervous system is gradually damaged.

The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation.

Thus far, the roles of PGC-1a in Alzheimer's disease and its potential value for restoring mitochondrial dysfunction remain largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Paralleling AD-related pathological deposits, neuronal apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and lowered membrane potential, a remarkable reduction in the expression of PGC-1a was shown in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice at 6 months of age. By infusing AAV-Ppargc1&#945; into the lateral parietal association (LPtA) cortex of the APP/PS1 brain, we found that PGC-1a ameliorated AD-like behavioral abnormalities, such as deficits in spatial reference memory, working memory and sensorimotor gating.

Cortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability intervenes in the pathological derangement of brain activity leading to cognitive decline. As key regulators of neuronal excitability, the voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) might play a crucial role in the AD pathophysiology. Among them, the KV2.1 channel, the main &#945; subunit mediating the delayed rectifier K+ currents (IDR) and controlling the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, has been poorly examined in AD. In the present study, we investigated the KV2.1 protein expression and activity in hippocampal neurons from the Tg2576 mouse, a widely used transgenic model of AD. To this aim we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our Western blotting results reveal that KV2.1 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice and in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse embryos compared with the WT counterparts. Electrophysiological experiments unveiled that the whole IDR were reduced in the Tg2576 primary neurons compared with the WT neurons, and that this reduction was due to the loss of the KV2.1 current component. Moreover, we found that the reduction of the KV2.1-mediated currents was due to increased channel clustering, and that glutamate, a stimulus inducing KV2.1 declustering, was able to restore the IDR to levels comparable to those of the WT neurons.

Though efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a consequence of an individual's genetic and environmental background and are best considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets for direct intervention.

Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and &#946;III-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. &#946;III-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls.

Speech analysis has shown promise in diagnosing neurodegenerative disease. To effectively leverage speech data, transcription is important, as there is valuable information contained in lexical content. Manual transcription, while highly accurate, limits the potential scalability and cost savings associated with language-based screening.To better understand the use of automatic transcription for classification of neurodegenerative disease, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or subjective memory complaints (SMC) versus healthy controls, we compared automatically generated transcripts against transcripts that went through manual correction.We recruited individuals from a memory clinic (\"patients\") with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD, (n=44, 30%), MCI (n=20, 13%), SMC (n=8, 5%), as well as healthy controls (n=77, 52%) living in the community. Participants were asked to describe a standardized picture, read a paragraph, and recall a pleasant life experience. We compared transcripts generated using Google speech-to-text software to manually verified transcripts by examining transcription confidence scores, transcription error rates, and machine learning classification accuracy. For the classification tasks, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forests were used.The transcription software showed higher confidence scores (P<.001) and lower error rates (P>.05) for speech from healthy controls compared with patients. Classification models using human-verified transcripts significantly (P<.001) outperformed automatically generated transcript models for both spontaneous speech tasks. This comparison showed no difference in the reading task. Manually adding pauses to transcripts had no impact on classification performance. However, manually correcting both spontaneous speech tasks led to significantly higher performances in the machine learning models.We found that automatically transcribed speech data could be used to distinguish patients with a diagnosis of AD, MCI, or SMC from controls. We recommend a human verification step to improve the performance of automatic transcripts, especially for spontaneous tasks. Moreover, human verification can focus on correcting errors and adding punctuation to transcripts. However, manual addition of pauses is not needed, which can simplify the human verification step to more efficiently process large volumes of speech data.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36129673": {"ArticleTitle": "Effect of tricyclic 1,2-thiazine derivatives in neuroinflammation induced by preincubation with lipopolysaccharide or coculturing with microglia-like cells.", "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most common cause of dementia among the elderly.

We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]).

Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances learning and memory, improves cognitive impairment, increases telomere binding protein expression, and decreases apoptosis regulators, but it remains unclear whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by neuronal apoptosis in AD. Therefore, this study investigated whether an 8-week running table exercise intervention could reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in the hippocampal neurons of AD model mice. After the exercise intervention, we evaluated the learning memory ability (positioning, navigation, and spatial search) of mice using a Morris water labyrinth, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and protein application to detect hippocampal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3&#946; signaling pathway protein and hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-promoting protein bcl-2-related X (Bax) protein expression. The results showed that aerobic exercise improved the location and spatial exploration ability of mice, increased the number of PI3K- and p-Akt-positive cells, increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and bcl-2 proteins, decreased the expression of GSK-3&#946; and Bax proteins, and increased the bcl-2/Bax ratio of mice.

The rates of change in various neuropsychological assessments were not significantly different between AD/DLB and AD patients, and each group had neuropsychological outcomes consistent with disease progression. For our neuroimaging analysis, we used a linear mixed effects model to examine if there were longitudinal differences in cortical rates of atrophy between AD/DLB and AD patients.Autopsies and serial neuroimaging was available on 48 patients (24 AD, 24 AD/DLB). Patients with AD alone had significantly higher atrophy rates in the left cuneus, lateral occipital, and parahippocampal regions over time when compared to patients with concomitant DLB, after covarying for interval from imaging to autopsy, gender, and total estimated intracranial volume (eTIV).

A total of 100 individuals with a diagnosis of aMCI according to NIA/AA will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. One group will receive active non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of greater occipital nerve (NITESGON), while three groups will serve as controls (i.e., sham NITESGON, active NITESGON with local anesthesia, and active NITESGON on the C5/C6 nerve). The primary outcome, i.e., memory recall, will be determined by a word association task, and will be recorded at baseline, 7 days after NITESGON, and 28 days after NITESGON. The secondary outcome is neurophysiological changes determined by resting state EEG and will be assessed immediately before and after NITESGON.The results will add new insights into improving episodic memory in individuals with aMCI.#NCT05289804 (clinicaltrial.gov).#SPREC102021-23 (Ethics Committee at Trinity College Dublin, School of Psychology).", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36117568": {"ArticleTitle": "Effects of dose change on the success of clinical trials.", "AbstractText": "The search for disease modifying therapies in Alzheimers disease (AD) has recently led to promising results but also revealed design issues in clinical trials themselves. Of particular importance is the potential statistical challenges that can arise when dosages change after an interim analysis, which is not uncommon in contemporary AD trials. Following the recent Aducanumab trials, we sought to study the implications of dose changes on the statistical power of an AD trial. We conducted extensive simulations to calculate statistical power when the relationship between treatment effect size and time is linear or non-linear, and the investigated drug has delayed treatment effect or not. Statistical power depends on many design factors including the dose change time, correlation, population homogeneity, and treatment effect time. We recommend that researchers conduct simulation studies at the interim analysis to justify the modified sample size and/or follow-up time modification meanwhile the type I and II error rates are controlled.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36117051": {"ArticleTitle": "Study of Alzheimer's disease- and frontotemporal dementia-associated genes in the Cretan Aging Cohort.", "AbstractText": "Using exome sequencing, we analyzed 196 participants of the Cretan Aging Cohort (CAC; 95 with Alzheimer's disease [AD], 20 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 81 cognitively normal controls).

In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495. LY379268 was also able to block pathologic tau propagation between primary neurons in an in vitro microfluidic cellular model. These novel results are transformational for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating tau release and propagation at synaptic terminals in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that these processes could be inhibited therapeutically by the selective activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pathological tau release and propagation are key neuropathological events underlying cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. This paper describes the role of regulated exocytosis, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein SNAP25, in mediating tau release from rodent and human synaptosomes. This paper also shows that a selective mGluR2/3 agonist is highly effective in blocking tau release from synaptosomes and tau propagation between neurons, opening the way to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disease.", "query": "Alzheimers"}, "36116712": {"ArticleTitle": "Brain microstructure abnormalities in the 3xTg-AD mouse - A diffusion MRI and morphology correlation study.", "AbstractText": "The widely studied triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse provides a robust model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with region dependent patterns of progressive amyloid-&#946; (A&#223;) and tau pathology. Using diffusion MRI (dMRI), we investigated the sensitivity of dMRI measures in capturing AD pathology associated microstructure alterations in older 3xTg-AD mice, and the degree to which dMRI changes correlate with measurements of A&#946; and tau pathology. 3xTg-AD and normal control (NC) mice, 15 to 21&#160;months of age, were used in this study. In vivo dMRI data were acquired for the generation of diffusion tensor (DT) and diffusional kurtosis (DK) measures within the hippocampus and fimbria (Fi). For these same brain regions, A&#946; and tau pathology were quantified by morphological analysis of A&#223;1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed to assess group differences in each brain region of interest (ROI), with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method being applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate associations between diffusion and morphological measures. Our results revealed, depending on the brain region, DT and DK measures were able to detect group differences. In the dorsal hippocampus (HD), fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly higher in the 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. In the subiculum (SUB), FA, axial diffusivity (D||) and radial kurtosis (K&#9524;) were significantly higher in 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. Morphological quantification of A&#223;1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity showed elevated A&#223; and tau in the Fi, ventral hippocampus (HV) and SUB of 3xTg-AD mice. The presence of A&#946; and tau was significantly correlated with several DT and DK measures, particularly in the SUB, where an increase in tau correlated with an increase in mean kurtosis (MK) and K&#9524;. This work demonstrates significant dMRI differences between older 3xTg-AD and NC mice in the hippocampus and Fi. Significant correlations were found between dMRI and morphological measures of A&#946; and tau pathology. These results support the potential of dMRI-derived parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology.

The neural basis of these functions in PSP and bvFTD groups, by analysis of structural neuroimaging, were also investigated. Twenty-three bvFTD patients, 21 PSP patients and 23 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent 3T brain MRI and a full cognitive exam including the short version of Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), which is composed of a facial emotion recognition test (FERT) and the faux pas test. Two components of the faux pas test were distinguished: a score assessing the recognition of social norms violation and a score assessing mentalizing. Compared to controls, bvFTD and PSP patients had significantly reduced scores in all tests of social cognition but did not differ on these measures. PSP and bvFTD had cerebral atrophy in critical regions for social cognition processes, when compared to controls. The cortical correlates of emotion recognition partially overlapped in bvFTD and PSP, with correlations retrieved within the frontal medial cortex, cingulate, insula and limbic structures. PSP and bvFTD patients also displayed similar patterns of brain correlations for the composite score of social norms, with a significant cluster in anterior temporal lobes. Mentalizing scores were associated with frontal and temporal poles bilaterally, in both bvFTD and PSP. These findings support previous observations that PSP patients exhibit impairment in complex cognitive abilities, such as mentalizing.
