Therefore, proper clearance and regulation are essential to maintain various physiological processes carried out by the cellular mechanism, including mitophagy and autophagy, by breaking down the damaged intracellular connections under the influence of various genes and proteins and protecting against various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Huntington disease (HD). In this review, we will discuss the role of autophagy, selective macroautophagy, or mitophagy, and its role in neurodegenerative diseases along with normal physiology. In addition, this review will provide a better understanding of the pathways involved in neuron autophagy and mitophagy and how mutations affect these pathways in the various genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Various new findings indicate that the pathways that remove dysfunctional mitochondria are impaired in these diseases, leading to the deposition of damaged mitochondria. Apart from that, we have also discussed the therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy and mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. The mitophagy cycle results in the degradation of damaged mitochondria and the biogenesis of new healthy mitochondria, also highlighting different stages at which a particular neurodegenerative disease could occur.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Despite increasing evidence of the importance of metabolic dysregulation in AD, the underlying metabolic changes that may impact amyloid plaque formation are not understood, particularly for late onset AD. This study analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), transcriptomics and proteomics data obtained from several data repositories to obtain differentially expressed (DE) multi-omics elements in mouse models of AD. We characterized the metabolic modulation in these datasets using gene ontology, transcription factor, pathway, and cell-type enrichment analyses. A predicted lipid signature was extracted from genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMN) and subsequently validated in a lipidomic dataset derived from cortical tissue of ABCA-7 null mice, a mouse model of one of the genes associated with late onset AD. Moreover, a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) was performed to further characterize the association between dysregulated lipid metabolism in human blood serum and genes associated with AD risk. We found 203 DE transcripts, 164 DE proteins and 58 DE GWAS-derived mouse orthologs associated with significantly enriched metabolic biological processes. Lipid and bioenergetics metabolic pathways were significantly over-represented across the AD multi-omics datasets. Microglia and astrocytes were significantly enriched in the lipid-predominant AD-metabolic transcriptome. We also extracted a predicted lipid signature that was validated and robustly modelled class separation in the ABCA7 mice cortical lipidome, with 11 of these lipid species exhibiting statistically significant modulations. MWAS revealed 298 AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-metabolite associations, of which 70% corresponded to lipid classes. These results support the importance of lipid metabolism dysregulation in AD and highlight the suitability of mapping AD multi-omics data into GSMNs to identify metabolic alterations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

Visual system might be precociously altered, especially for its cholinergic connections. We thus studied patients with aMCI compared to AD with paired-pulse flash-visual evoked potentials (paired-F-VEPs), a putative marker of cholinergic function. <i>Methods.</i> We enrolled 12 adult patients with aMCI and 12 with AD. 14 normal age- and sex-matched subjects acted as controls (HS). Stimuli were single flashes, with interspersed random flash pairs at critical interstimulus intervals (ISIs, 16.5 to 125&#8197;ms) with closed eyes. The \"single\" (unconditioned) F-VEP was split into a \"main complex\" (50 to 200&#8197;ms after the flash) and a \"late response\" (200 to 400&#8197;ms). As for paired stimulation, the \"test\" F-VEP emerged from electronic subtraction of the \"single\" F-VEP from the \"paired\"-F-VEP. <i>Results.</i> In the single F-VEP, P2 latency was prolonged in patients (aMCI and AD) compared to HS (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.05). As to the paired F-VEPs, in aMCI the \"late response\" normal inhibition was abolished at ISIs 50-62.5&#8197;ms (<i>p</i>&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;.016), compared to AD and controls. No changes were detected for the \"main complex\". <i>Conclusions.</i> Paired-F-VEPs demonstrate a defective neural inhibition in the visual system of patients with aMCI at critical intervals. It may represent a compensatory mechanism against neuronal loss, the failure of which may be involved in AD development. Paired-F-VEPs may warrant inclusion in future preclinical/clinical studies, to evaluate its potential role in the pathophysiology and management of aMCI.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

In humans, apoE isoforms form disulfide-linked dimers in CSF, except apoE4, which lacks a cysteine residue. Thus, controls showed a decrease in the apoE dimer/monomer quotient in the APOE &#949;3/&#949;4 group compared with &#949;3/&#949;3 by native electrophoresis. A major contribution of dimers was found in APOE &#949;3/&#949;4 AD cases, and, unexpectedly, dimers were also found in &#949;4/&#949;4 AD cases. Under reducing conditions, two apoE monomeric glycoforms at 36 kDa and at 34 kDa were found in all human samples. In AD patients, the amount of the 34-kDa species increased, while the 36-kDa/34-kDa quotient was lower compared with controls. Interestingly, under reducing conditions, a ~100-kDa apoE complex, the identity of which was confirmed by mass spectrometry, also appeared in human AD individuals across all APOE genotypes, suggesting the occurrence of aberrantly resistant apoE aggregates. A second independent cohort of CSF samples validated these results.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">These results indicate that despite the increase in total apoE content the apoE protein is altered in AD CSF, suggesting that function may be compromised.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, the few studies assessing AD biomarkers in association with NPS have often suffered from imprecision in capturing behavioral symptoms that represent sequalae of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, the mild behavioral impairment (MBI) construct was developed, framing NPS in a way to improve the precision of risk estimates for disease.

Hospitalization increases the risk of sleep disturbances due to inactivity, some sensory deprivation and daytime hypovigilance. The therapeutic gardens offer in an attractive, sensorially stimulating setting and exposed to natural light, the possibility of an adapted physical exercise. Their impact on the quality and quantity of sleep in cognitive-behavioral units has been evaluated in an exploratory manner. The hypnogram of two groups of 30 patients was compared depending on whether they used the garden (weather permitting, in summer) or not (in winter). The results show that the patients who use the garden are significantly more active during the day, have a longer nighttime sleep duration and are less restless at night. In addition, patients who use and walk longer in the garden benefit from an increase in their sleep time. In view of their multiple interests, therapeutic gardens, if they meet validated design criteria, should be integrated more widely into establishments welcoming people with neurocognitive diseases.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

AD worsens over time and greatly impacts patients' life and affects their important mental functions, including thinking, the ability to carry on a conversation, and judgment and response to environment. Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network. The proposed analysis pipeline has been tested and evaluated on benchmark ADNI dataset collected from 379 subjects patients. Quantitative validation of the obtained results documented our framework's capability, outperforming state-of-the-art learning approaches for both multi-and binary-class AD detection.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

ARIA typically occurs early in the treatment course and has a higher incidence in patients who are apolipoprotein E &#949;4 allele carriers. ARIA-E has an additional dose dependence, with higher incidence in patients receiving higher doses of anti-A&#946; immunotherapies. ARIA is often asymptomatic and self-resolving.

In this study, we reinvestigated her brain and spinal cord in more detail. Severe cerebrovascular lesions and cervical spondylotic myelopathy were found to be the main causes of her disability. Although the density of senile plaques was relatively high, the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles was limited. Ghost tangles and argyrophilic grains were mild.

Polyinosinic:polycitidylic acid (poly[I:C]) is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist that mimics the inflammatory response to systemic viral infections. Despite a growing recognition of a role for glial cells in AD pathology, their involvement in the accumulation and clearance of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) in the brain of patients with AD is poorly understood. Neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the main A&#946;-degrading enzymes in the brain. This study investigated whether poly(I:C) regulated A&#946; degradation and neurotoxicity by modulating NEP and IDE protein levels through TLR3 in astrocytes. To this aim, primary rat primary astrocyte cultures were treated with poly(I:C) and inhibitors of the TLR3 signaling. Protein levels were assessed by Western blot. A&#946; toxicity to primary neurons was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release. Poly(I:C) induced a significant decrease of NEP levels on the membrane of astrocytes as well as in the culture medium. The degradation of exogenous A&#946; was markedly delayed in poly(I:C)-treated astrocytes. This delay significantly increased the neurotoxicity of exogenous A&#946;1-42. Altogether, these results suggest that viral infections induce A&#946; neurotoxicity by decreasing NEP levels in astrocytes and consequently preventing A&#946; degradation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

Recent studies have indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction is a direct reason to promote the development of AD. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, is a key channel of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Abnormal MCU expression results in imbalance of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of MCU knockdown on AD hippocampal neurons and learning and memory function of AD model mice. Lentivirus and adeno-associated virus were used as vectors to transfect shRNA into hippocampal neurons (HT22 cells) and hippocampi of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1)/tau AD transgenic mice, respectively, in order to interfere with MCU expression. The cellular activity of HT22 cells was detected by MTS method, and the changes of learning and memory dysfunction in APP/PS1/tau AD transgenic mice were tested by Y maze and Morris water maze. The results showed that MCU knockdown reversed the cellular activity of HT22 cells decreased by amyloid beta protein 1-42 (A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>) or okadaic acid (OA). Knockdown of MCU in hippocampal neurons improved spontaneous alternation (spatial working memory), decreased escape latency, and increased time in target quadrant and number of platform crossing (spatial reference memory) of the APP/PS1/tau mice. This study suggests that MCU knockdown in hippocampal neurons has anti-AD effect, and it is expected to be a new strategy for prevention and treatment of AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Evidence shows that AD neuropathology occurs decades before clinical presentation. AD is divided into three stages: preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. In the natural world, some animals, such as non-human primates (NHPs) and canines, can develop spontaneous AD-like dementia. However, most animals do not develop AD. With the development of transgenic techniques, both invertebrate and vertebrate animals have been employed to uncover the mechanisms of AD and study treatment methods. Most AD research focuses on early-onset familial AD (FAD) because FAD is associated with specific genetic mutations. However, there are no well-established late-onset sporadic AD (SAD) animal models because SAD is not directly linked to any genetic mutation, and multiple environmental factors are involved. Moreover, the widely used animal models are not able to sufficiently recapitulate the pathological events that occur in the MCI or preclinical stages. This review summarizes the common models used to study AD, from yeast to NHP models, and discusses the different applications, evaluation methods, and challenges related to AD animal models, as well as prospects for the evolution of future studies.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

It is not always clear whether AD biomarker information should be disclosed to research participants: on the one hand, research participants may be interested in learning this information because of its perceived utility, but on the other hand, learning this information may be harmful, as there are very few effective preventive or therapeutic options available for AD. In this article, we bring together three separate sets of ethical guidance literature: on the return of individual research results, on an individual's right to access personal data, and on transparent enrollment into clinical trials. Based on these literatures, we suggest policies for the disclosure of AD biomarker test results in longitudinal observational cohort studies, clinical trials, and hybrid research projects, such as the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) project, in which we served as an ethics team. We also present and critically discuss recommendations for disclosure of AD biomarkers in practice. We underscore that, as long as the clinical validity of AD biomarkers remains limited, there are good reasons to avoid actively disclosing them to cognitively unimpaired research participants.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 by The Hastings Center.

NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A&#946;) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A&#946;-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A&#946; plaques (average age of death of 83.1&#160;yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p&#8201;=&#8201;0.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models. These findings support the hypothesis that NFT burden correlates with cognitive impairment in PART. Furthermore, our analysis strongly suggests that AI-derived metrics of tau pathology provide a powerful tool that can deepen our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in cognitive impairment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

According to several studies, the critical factor in this relationship is brain insulin resistance. Due to the rapid global spread of both diseases, overcoming this cross-talk has a significant impact on societies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), on the other hand, have a substantial impact on complex diseases due to their ability to influence gene expression via a variety of mechanisms. Consequently, the regulation of lncRNA expression in chronic diseases permits the development of innovative therapeutic techniques. However, developing a new drug requires considerable time and money. Recently repurposing existing drugs has gained popularity due to the use of low-risk compounds, which may result in cost and time savings. in this study,&#160;we identified drug repurposing candidates capable of controlling the expression of common lncRNAs in the cross-talk between DM and AD. We also utilized drugs that interfered with this cross-talk. To do this, high degree common lncRNAs were extracted from microRNA-lncRNA bipartite network. The drugs that interact with the specified lncRNAs were then collected from multiple data sources. These drugs, referred to as set D, were classified in to positive (D<sup>+</sup>) and negative (D<sup>-</sup>) groups based on their effects on the expression of the interacting lncRNAs. A feature selection algorithm was used to select six important features for D. Using a random forest classifier, these features were capable of classifying D<sup>+</sup> and D<sup>-</sup> with an accuracy of 82.5%. Finally, the same six features were extracted for the most recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs in order to identify those with the highest likelihood of belonging to D<sup>+</sup> or D<sup>-</sup>. The most significant FDA-approved positive drugs, chromium nicotinate and tapentadol, were presented as repurposing candidates, while cefepime and dihydro-alpha-ergocryptine were recommended as significant adverse drugs. Moreover, two natural compounds, curcumin and quercetin, were recommended to prevent this cross-talk. According to the previous studies, less attention has been paid to the role of lncRNAs in this cross-talk. Our research not only did identify important lncRNAs, but it also suggested potential repurposed drugs to control them.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPRi screen in tau biosensor cells and identified cellular regulators shared by both mechanisms of tau seeding. We identified ANKLE2, BANF1, NUSAP1, EIF1AD, and VPS18 as the top validated regulators that restrict tau aggregation initiated by both exosomal and vesicle-free tau seeds. None of our validated hits affected the uptake of either form of tau seeds, supporting the notion that they operate through a cell-autonomous mechanism downstream of the seed uptake.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Senile plaques, which are mostly composed of beta-amyloid peptide, are the main signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two main forms of beta-amyloid in humans are 40 and 42-amino acid, long; the latter is considered more relevant to AD etiology. The concentration of soluble beta-amyloid-42 (A&#946;42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-A&#946;42) and the density of amyloid depositions have a strong negative correlation. However, AD patients have lower CSF-A&#946;42 levels compared to individuals with normal cognition (NC), even after accounting for this correlation. The goal of this study was to infer deviations of A&#946;42 metabolism parameters that underlie this difference using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. A&#946;42 is released to the interstitial fluid (ISF) by cells and is removed by several processes. First, growth of insoluble fibrils by aggregation decreases the concentration of soluble beta-amyloid in the ISF. Second, A&#946;42 is physically transferred from the brain to the CSF and removed with the CSF flow. Finally, there is an intratissue removal of A&#946;42 ending in proteolysis, which can occur either in the ISF or inside the cells after the peptide is endocytosed. Unlike aggregation, which preserves the peptide in the brain, transfer to the CSF and intratissue proteolysis together represent amyloid removal. Using a kinetic model of A&#946;42 turnover, we found that compared to NC subjects, AD patients had dramatically increased rates of amyloid removal. A group with late-onset mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) also exhibited a higher rate of amyloid removal; however, this was less pronounced than in the AD group. Estimated parameters in the early-onset MCI group did not differ significantly from those in the NC group. We hypothesize that increased amyloid removal is mediated by A&#946;42 cellular uptake; this is because CSF flow is not increased in AD patients, while most proteases are intracellular. A&#946; cytotoxicity depends on both the amount of beta-amyloid internalized by cells and its intracellular conversion into toxic products. We speculate that AD and LMCI are associated with increased cellular amyloid uptake, which leads to faster disease progression. The early-onset MCI (EMCI) patients do not differ from the NC participants in terms of cellular amyloid uptake. Therefore, EMCI may be mediated by the increased production of toxic amyloid metabolites.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

An additional 29 genes were differentially expressed by age in three of four regions. Analyses of a combined expression data set of all four regions identified 77 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by age group. Among these DEGs, older subjects had elevated levels of <i>CTSB</i> <i>, EBAG9</i>, <i>LAMTOR3</i>, and <i>MRPL17</i>, and lower levels of <i>COMMD10</i> and <i>TYW1B</i>.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was used for an evaluation of the global cognitive function. The Hachinski ischemic score was used to distinguish patients with VD from those with AD. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein -cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) levels were determined using standard enzymatic colorimetric techniques, whereas the Friedewald formula was used to calculate low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The non-traditional lipid indices such as TG/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were separately calculated.

Upon activation, c-Abl regulates signaling pathways related to cytoskeletal reorganization. It plays a vital role in modulating cell protrusion, cell migration, morphogenesis, adhesion, endocytosis and phagocytosis. A large number of studies have also found that abnormally activated c-Abl plays an important role in a variety of pathologies, including various inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. c-Abl also plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, mainly through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress (OS), and Tau protein phosphorylation. Inhibiting expression or activity of this kinase has certain neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects and can also improve cognition and behavior. Blockers of this kinase may have good preventive and treatment effects on neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia is also closely related to the abovementioned mechanisms. We infer that alterations in the expression and activity of c-Abl may underlie postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). This article summarizes the current understanding and research progress on the mechanisms by which c-Abl may be related to postoperative neurodegeneration.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The author(s).</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Previous studies have demonstrated increased responsiveness to NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome agonists, both in individuals with untreated T2DM in addition to those with established AD. We hypothesised that peripheral NLRP3 inflammasome responses may be altered during the early stages of T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction. Here, we assessed the relationship between NLPR3 responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (including to A&#946;-42, the putative pathogenic protein in AD) and neuropsychological performance in uncomplicated midlife T2DM to identify early signatures of immune dysregulation which may predispose to later cognitive decline. We recruited a cross-sectional cohort of middle-aged adults with uncomplicated T2DM and matched Healthy Controls (HCs) for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and <i>in vitro</i> PBMC responses to a range of NLRP3 agonists were assessed. T2DM was associated with subtle decrements on neuropsychological tests of delayed memory and executive function (both p&lt;0.05). Overall, there were no differences between T2DM and HCs in immune responses induced by NLRP3 agonists. Further, we observed no relationship between the subtle neuropsychological decrements observed in T2DM and PBMC responsiveness to NLRP3 agonists. Our data suggests that peripheral NLRP3 inflammasome response dysregulation may not play a role in the early stages of cognitive dysfunction in midlife T2DM. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to examine the contribution of peripheral NLRP3 responses towards disease pathology and as cognitive decline accelerates in T2DM.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Dyer, Batten, Reddy, Townsend, Woods, O&#8217;Neill, Gibney, Kennelly and Bourke.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

The growth is hampered by excluded-volume interactions that are encoded by the hydrophilic spacers but are rendered cooperative by the attractive interactions of hydrophobic spacers. For sufficiently strong hydrophobicity, the chains undergo liquid-liquid phase-separation (LLPS) into condensates that facilitate the nucleation of fibers.

An increasing number of studies have shown that intestinal flora play a crucial role in regulating the brain-gut axis. Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites of intestinal flora that regulate hormone synthesis and play an essential role in microbial-intestinal-brain communication. An imbalance of intestinal flora can promote microglia to secrete proinflammatory factors, cause nerve inflammation, and then affect cognitive and learning ability. However, the mechanism is not clear. From this, we infer that endogenous hormones may be the medium for intestinal flora to affect the process of AD. This review of the relationships among AD, endogenous hormones, and intestinal flora expounds on the critical role of various hormones in the brain-gut axis. It discusses intervention measures aimed at intestinal flora to prevent or delay AD occurrence.

Firstly, we used aluminium-maltol (Al(mal)<sub>3</sub>) to construct a mouse model of AD and performed oral administration of AS, followed by behavioral experiments, and we collected the mouse brain for immunohistochemistry analysis. In vivo results showed that AS significantly improved Al-induced cognitive decline in mice, and reduced the levels of A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> and P-Tau in the brain, which further proved the anti-AD effect of AS. Then, in order to explore the mechanism by which AS reduced A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>, Al-induced PC12 cells were used for the in vitro experiments.

According to western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, AS ameliorated the pathological process by downregulating the expression of &#946;-secretase (BACE1), rather than by reducing the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau. These results suggest that AS ameliorated Al-induced AD by affecting the expression of BACE1 and reducing the level of A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect.

Cyclophilins are a promising pool of underinvestigated chaperones with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity that may play protective roles in regulating tau aggregation. Using a Thioflavin T fluorescence-based assay to monitor in vitro tau aggregation, all eight cyclophilins, which include PPIA to PPIH prevent tau aggregation, with PPIB, PPIC, PPID, and PPIH showing the greatest inhibition. The low thermal stability of PPID and the strong heparin binding of PPIB undermines the simplistic interpretation of reduced tau aggregation. In a cellular model of tau accumulation, all cyclophilins, except PPID and PPIH, reduce insoluble tau. PPIB, PPIC, PPIE, and PPIF also reduce soluble tau levels with PPIC exclusively protecting cells from tau seeding. Overall, this study demonstrates cyclophilins prevent tau fibril formation and many reduce cellular insoluble tau accumulation with PPIC having the greatest potential as a molecular tool to mitigate tau seeding and accumulation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Protein Society.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Mounting evidence supported accumulation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) as the primary cause of AD pathology and sprouted a number of candidate treatments engaging A&#946; from its production to its clearance, yet no amyloid-based drug candidate had been proven effective. Alternative pathomechanisms have been proposed, but still current treatments are limited to symptomatic therapy. Aducanumab (BIIB-037) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively binds aggregated forms of A&#946;, inhibits its template activity and promotes clearance of A&#946; deposits. Three early terminated trials in humans are available. Overall, conflicting results exist over measures of clinical efficacy, despite an objective decrease in A&#946; burden. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities emerge as the most significant treatment-related adverse event.

Objective This study aimed to investigate the effects EA on learning and memory dysfunction as well as oxidative stress in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Methods The studied rats were treated according to the following protocol: Control (group 1) and scopolamine (group 2) groups received saline (intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) while the treatment groups (group 3-5) were given EA (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) for 3 weeks. Thereafter, their behavioral performance was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tasks. Notably, scopolamine was injected (into groups II-V at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.p.) before conducting the tasks. Finally, the oxidative stress indicators in the brain were measured. Results EA reduced the escape latencies and distances during learning phase of MWM. The results of probe trials also indicated that EA improved memory retrieval and helped the animals recall the platform. Moreover, EA increased delay and light time, while decreasing the frequency of entries to the dark area of PA. In the EA-treated groups, the level of malondialdehyde was decreased, while the levels of total thiol groups, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were increased. Conclusion EA prevented the negative effects of scopolamine on learning and memory which is probably mediated via modulating oxidative stress.

The advanced progression may be due to decreased hormone synthesis during post-menopause as estradiol and progesterone both have neuroprotective potentials. We aimed to confirm that female hormone depletion aggravates the progression of dementia in a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD). As pathological hallmarks are known to appear in 6-month-old animals, we expected to see disease-like changes in the 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice only after hormone depletion. Three-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were compared with their age-matched controls. As a menopause model, ovaries were removed (OVX or Sham surgery). After 1-month recovery, the body composition of the animals was measured by an MRI scan. The cognitive and anxiety parameters were evaluated by different behavioral tests, modeling different aspects (Y-maze, Morris water maze, open-field, social discrimination, elevated plus maze, light-dark box, fox odor, operant conditioning, and conditioned fear test). At the end of the experiment, uterus was collected, amyloid-&#946; accumulation, and the cholinergic system in the brain was examined by immunohistochemistry. The uterus weight decreased, and the body weight increased significantly in the OVX animals. The MRI data showed that the body weight change can be due to fat accumulation. Moreover, OVX increased anxiety in control, but decreased in 3xTg-AD animals, the later genotype being more anxious by default based on the anxiety z-score. In general, 3xTg-AD mice moved less. In relation to cognition, neither the 3xTg-AD genotype nor OVX surgery impaired learning and memory in general. Despite no progression of dementia-like behavior after OVX, at the&#160;histological level, OVX aggravated the amyloid-&#946; plaque deposition in the basolateral amygdala and induced early cholinergic neuronal fiber loss in the somatosensory cortex of the transgenic animals. We confirmed that OVX induced menopausal symptoms. Removal of the sexual steroids aggravated the appearance of AD-related alterations in the brain without significantly affecting the behavior. Thus, the OVX in young, 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice might be a suitable model for testing the effect of new treatment options on structural changes; however, to reveal any beneficial effect on behavior, a later time point might be needed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Farkas, Szab&#243;, T&#246;r&#246;k, S&#243;lyomv&#225;ri, Fazekas, B&#225;nr&#233;vi, Correia, Chaves and Zelena.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

In particular, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease constitute a major health and socio-economic challenge with increasing incidence in many industrialized countries with aging populations. Recent work has established the primary role of abnormal protein accumulation and the spread of disease-specific deposits in brain as a factor in neurotoxicity and disruption of functional networks. A range of therapeutics from small molecules to antibodies targeting these proteinopathies are now in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. These studies are methodologically challenging owing to difficulty of accurate diagnosis in early disease, the slow and variable rates of progression between individuals, and efficacy measures which may be cofounded by the symptomatic improvements due to treatment that does not reflect disease course modification. Further, the ideal candidates for these treatments would be at-risk, or premanifest persons in whom the pathological process of the neurodegenerative disorder has begun, but who are clinically normal and extremely difficult to identify. Scintigraphic imaging with PET and SPECT in trials offers the opportunity to interrogate pathophysiologic processes like protein deposition with high specificity.

In this study, potent hybrid donepezils previously reported as AChE inhibitors were investigated to gain an insight into the key binding interaction of their scaffolds, using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations. The results indicated that the key interactions found in both donepezil and the selected hybrid donepezils were the &#960;-&#960; interaction to Trp86 in the catalytic anionic site (CAS) and Trp286 and Tyr341 in the peripheral anionic site (PAS) in the AChE binding pocket. Moreover, the modification of the scaffolds revealed the adaptation of the orientation in the binding pocket and additional important interactions from the modified scaffold, such as H-bond and H-&#960; interactions to Asp74, Tyr124 and Tyr337. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO prediction indicated the binding interaction by considering the electron transfer between the hybrid donepezils and key residues, such as Trp86 and Trp286. The bioavailability, drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics predictions confirmed the suitability of the hybrid donepezils for AD drug development. Most of the selected hybrid donepezils revealed good bioavailability, drug-likeness properties and pharmacokinetics; however, some need improved pharmacokinetic properties.

We also evaluated the correlations between the epidemiology and the sociodemographic index (SDI), an indicator to evaluate the level of social development in a country or region considering the education rate, economic situation, and total fertility rate.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"Results\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer\\'s disease and other dementias increased by 147.95 and 160.84%, respectively. The ASR of incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs in both men and women consistently increased over the study period. All the ASRs in women were consistently higher than those in men, but the increases were more pronounced in men. In addition, the ASRs of incidence, prevalence, and DALYs were positively correlated with the SDI. Moreover, the proportion of patients over 70 years old with dementia was also positively correlated with the SDI level. Smoking was a major risk factor for the disease burden of dementia in men, while obesity was the major risk factor for women.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"Conclusion\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">From 1990 to 2019, the Alzheimer\\'s disease burden increased worldwide. This trend was more serious in high-SDI areas, especially among elderly populations in high-SDI areas, who should receive additional attention. Policy-makers should take steps to reverse this situation. Notably, women were at a higher risk for the disease, but the risk in men showed a faster increase. We should give attention to the aging population, attach importance to interventions targeting dementia risk factors, and formulate action plans to address the increasing incidence of dementia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Li, Feng, Sun, Hou, Han and Liu.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Group I: normal control, Group II: diabetic control, Group III: standard treated with glibenclamide and Group lV-VII: treated with methanolic crude extracts (100, 200 mg/kg), nuciferine and norcoclaurine (10 mg/kg b.w.) for 15 days. Different tests were performed, including blood glucose, body weights and antioxidant enzyme assays, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase test (CAT), lipid peroxidation assay (TBARS), glutathione assay (GSH) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assay. Nuciferine and norcoclaurine significantly reduced blood glucose (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) and restored body weight in diabetic rats.

Moreover, artichoke agricultural wastes can represent according to the current United Nations Sustainable Development goals an opportunity to produce medicinally valuable phenolic-rich extracts. In this context, the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS phytochemical characterization of artichoke bracts extract revealed the presence of mono- and di-caffeoylquinic acids and apigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol <i>O</i>-glycosides with remarkable total phenolics and flavonoids contents. A broad antioxidant spectrum was established in vitro. Artichoke-loaded, chitosan-coated, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared and characterized for their size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, release, and ex vivo permeation and showed suitable colloidal characteristics, a controlled release profile, and promising ex vivo permeation, indicating possibly better physicochemical and biopharmaceutical parameters than free artichoke extract. The anti-Alzheimer potential of the extract and prepared SLNs was assessed in vivo in streptozotocin-induced sporadic Alzheimer mice. A great improvement in cognitive functions and spatial memory recovery, in addition to a marked reduction of the inflammatory biomarker TNF-&#945;, &#946;-amyloid, and tau protein levels, were observed. Significant neuroprotective efficacy in dentate Gyrus sub-regions was achieved in mice treated with free artichoke extract and to a significantly higher extent with artichoke-loaded SLNs.

Recently, the contribution of peripheral systems, particularly the liver, to A&#946; clearance has sparked an increased interest. In addition, AD presents pathological features similar to those of metabolic syndrome, and the critical involvement of brain energy metabolic disturbances in this disease has been recognized. More importantly, the liver may be a key regulator in these abnormalities, far beyond our past understanding. Here, we review recent animal and clinical findings indicating that liver dysfunction represents an early event in AD pathophysiology. We further propose that compromised peripheral A&#946; clearance by the liver and aberrant hepatic physiological processes may contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The role of a hepatic synthesis product, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), in the management of AD is also discussed. A deeper understanding of the communication between the liver and brain may lead to new opportunities for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Although many anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) drugs are already available on the market, their performance sometimes yields unexpected results. For this reason, research works are ongoing to find potential anti-AChE agents both from natural and synthetic sources. In this study, 90 extracts from 30 native and naturalized medicinal plants are tested by TLC and Ellman's colorimetric assay at 250, 125 and 62.5 &#956;g/mL in order to determine the inhibitory effect on AChE.

Among them, ethanolic extract from aerial parts of <i>O. vulgare</i> ssp. <i>vulgare</i> shows an IC50 value 7.7 times lower than galantamine. This research also establishes the chemical profile of oregano extract by TLC, HPLC-DAD and LC-MS, and twenty-three compounds are identified and quantified. Dihydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids are the most abundant ones (56.90 and 25.94%, respectively). Finally, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties are quantified by colorimetric methods. The total phenolic content is 207.64 &#177; 0.69 &#181;g/mg of extract.

The proposed Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Network (DAD-Net) is developed from scratch to correctly classify the phases of Alzheimer's disease while reducing parameters and computation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a severe problem with class imbalance. Therefore, we used a synthetic oversampling technique to distribute the image throughout the classes and avoid the problem.

Saponins consist of an aglycone part (non-sugar) and a glycone part (sugar) and have at least one glycosidic (C-O sugar bond) linkage present between the glycone and aglycone mostly at C-3. On the basis of the aglycone part, saponins are classified into triterpenoid glycosides, steroid glycosides and alkaloid glycosides. Saponins exhibit neuroprotective activities against various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

In <i>Homo sapiens</i>, the major sources of LPSs are gastrointestinal (GI)-tract-resident facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, including <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. LPSs have been abundantly detected in aged human brain by multiple independent research investigators, and an increased abundance of LPSs around and within Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected neurons has been found. Microbiome-generated LPSs and other endotoxins cross GI-tract biophysiological barriers into the systemic circulation and across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, a pathological process that increases during aging and in vascular disorders, including 'leaky gut syndrome'. Further evidence indicates that LPSs up-regulate pro-inflammatory transcription factor complex NF-kB (p50/p65) and subsequently a set of NF-kB-sensitive microRNAs, including miRNA-30b, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. These up-regulated miRNAs in turn down-regulate a family of neurodegeneration-associated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, including the mRNA encoding the neuron-specific neurofilament light (NF-L) chain protein. While NF-L has been reported to be up-regulated in peripheral biofluids in AD and other progressive and lethal pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders, NF-L is significantly down-regulated within neocortical neurons, and this may account for neuronal atrophy, loss of axonal caliber and alterations in neuronal cell shape, modified synaptic architecture and network deficits in neuronal signaling capacity. This paper reviews and reveals the most current findings on the neurotoxic aspects of LPSs and how these pro-inflammatory glycolipids contribute to the biological mechanism of progressive, age-related and ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disorders. This recently discovered gut-microbiota-derived LPS-NF-kB-miRNA-30b-NF-L pathological signaling network: <b>(i)</b> underscores a direct positive pathological link between the LPSs of GI-tract microbes and the inflammatory neuropathology, disordered cytoskeleton, and disrupted synaptic-signaling of the AD brain and stressed human brain cells in primary culture; and <b>(ii)</b> is the first example of a microbiome-derived neurotoxic glycolipid having significant detrimental miRNA-mediated actions on the expression of NF-L, an abundant filamentous protein known to be important in the maintenance of neuronal and synaptic homeostasis.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

We performed quantitative lipoprotein analysis in a local cohort of cognitively impaired elderly and control subjects using standardized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A commercially available quantitative NMR-based assay covering 112 lipoprotein main and subtype variables was used to investigate blood serum samples from a moderate cohort size of 161 persons (71 female, 90 male), including measures of quality control. Additionally, clinical metadata and cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers were collected and used for analysis. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) HDL-4 subfraction levels were mostly high in female individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by AD. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) LDL-2 cholesterol was slightly elevated in male AD patients. HDL-2 apolipoprotein Apo-A1, HDL-2 phospholipids, and HDL-3 triglycerides were highly abundant in AD and MCI women compared to men. When considering clinical biomarkers (A&#946;, tau), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) VLDL-1 and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) triglycerides were substantially higher in AD compared to MCI. In addition, triglyceride levels correlated positively with dementia. Different lipoprotein serum patterns were identified for AD, MCI, and control subjects. Interestingly, HDL-4 and LDL-2 cholesterol parameters revealed strong gender-specific changes in the context of AD-driven dementia. As gender-based comparisons were based on smaller sub-groups with a low n-number, several statistical findings did not meet the significance threshold for multiple comparisons testing. Still, our finding suggests that serum HDL-4 parameters and various triglycerides correlate positively with AD pathology which could be a read-out of extended lipids traveling through the blood-brain barrier, supporting amyloid plaque formation processes. Thereof, we see herein a proof of concept that this quantitative NMR-based lipoprotein assay can generate important and highly interesting data for refined AD diagnosis and patient stratification, especially when larger cohorts are available.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

To advance our knowledge about the role of GIIA in AD, we studied the effect of rat GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria and compared it with that of the Atx. We produced recombinant rat GIIA (rGIIA) and its enzymatically inactive mutant, rGIIA(D49S), and demonstrated that they interact with the subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (CCOX-II) as Atx. rGIIA and rGIIA(D49S) bound to this essential constituent of the respiratory chain complex with an approximately 100-fold lower affinity than Atx; nevertheless, both rGIIA molecules potently inhibited the CCOX activity in the isolated rat mitochondria. Like Atx, rGIIA was able to reach the mitochondria in the PC12 cells from the extracellular space, independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, the inhibition of the CCOX activity in the intact PC12 cells and in the rat's brain tissue sections was clearly demonstrated using rGIIA(D49S). Our results show that the effects of mammalian and snake venom &#946;-neurotoxic GIIA on the neuronal mitochondria have similar molecular backgrounds. They suggest that the elevated extracellular concentration of GIIA in the AD tissue drives the translocation of this enzyme into local neurons and their mitochondria to inhibit the activity of the CCOX in the respiratory chain. Consequently, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the neurons is attenuated, eventually leading to their degeneration. Atx was thus revealed as a valuable molecular tool for further investigations of the role of GIIA in AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have established that E2F4 can also play a relevant role in cell and tissue homeostasis, as well as tissue regeneration. For these non-canonical functions, E2F4 can also act in the cytoplasm, where it is able to interact with many homeostatic and synaptic regulators. Since E2F4 is expressed in the nervous system, it may fulfill a crucial role in brain function and homeostasis, being a promising multifactorial target for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. The regulation of E2F4 is complex, as it can be chemically modified through acetylation, from which we present evidence in the brain, as well as methylation, and phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of E2F4 within a conserved threonine motif induces cell cycle re-entry in neurons, while a dominant negative form of E2F4 (E2F4DN), in which the conserved threonines have been substituted by alanines, has been shown to act as a multifactorial therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We generated transgenic mice neuronally expressing E2F4DN. We have recently shown using this mouse strain that expression of E2F4DN in 5xFAD mice, a known murine model of AD, improved cognitive function, reduced neuronal tetraploidization, and induced a transcriptional program consistent with modulation of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) peptide proteostasis and brain homeostasis recovery. 5xFAD/E2F4DN mice also showed reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 3-6 months of age.

Accumulating evidence over the last three decades demonstrates that epigenetic mechanisms and dynamic changes in chromatin organization are critical components during the control of gene transcription in neural cells. Recent genome-wide analyses show that the regulation of brain genes requires the contribution of both promoter and long-distance enhancer elements, which must functionally interact with upregulated gene expression in response to physiological cues. Hence, a deep comprehension of the mechanisms mediating these enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) is critical if we are to understand the processes associated with learning, memory and recall. Moreover, the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases and neurological alterations are found to be strongly associated with changes in the components that support and/or modulate the dynamics of these EPIs. Here, we overview relevant discoveries in the field supporting the role of the chromatin organization and of specific epigenetic mechanisms during the control of gene transcription in neural cells from healthy mice subjected to the fear conditioning paradigm, a relevant model to study memory ensemble.

Its deregulation is associated with many pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disease, frequently downregulated.

Interestingly, novel Wnt signaling activating compounds are less frequently described than inhibitors, turning the quest for novel positive modulators even more appealing. In that sense, natural compounds are an outstanding source of potential drug leads. Here, we combine different experimental models, cell-based approaches, neuronal culture assays, and rodent behavior tests with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> phenotypic analysis to characterize quercitrin, a natural compound, as a novel Wnt signaling potentiator. We find that quercitrin potentiates the signaling in a concentration-dependent manner and increases the occurrence of the <i>Xenopus</i> secondary axis phenotype mediated by <i>Xwnt8</i> injection. Using a GSK3 biosensor, we describe that quercitrin impairs GSK3 activity and increases phosphorylated GSK3&#946; S9 levels. Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor downstream of GSK3, impairs the quercitrin-mediated effect. Next, we show that quercitrin potentiates the Wnt3a-synaptogenic effect in hippocampal neurons in culture, which is blocked by XAV939. Quercitrin treatment also rescues the hippocampal synapse loss induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-&#946; oligomers (A&#946;O) in mice. Finally, quercitrin rescues A&#946;O-mediated memory impairment, which is prevented by XAV939.

We screened eight peptide candidates using the following criteria: (1) Inhibition and reversion of amyloid beta (A&#946;) oligomers, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) direct binding of peptide candidates to the human receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), quantified by ELISA; (3) protection against A&#946; oligomer-induced neuronal cell death, using trypan blue to measure cell death in a murine neuronal cell line; (4) inhibition of TLR4 activation by S100A9, using a human TLR4 reporter cell line. We selected a 27-mer lead peptide that fulfilled these four criteria. This lead peptide is a privileged structure that displays inherent multitarget activity. This peptide is expected to significantly impact cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, by targeting both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The neuropathological changes in AD are related to the deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and progression of neuroinflammation, neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy dysfunction, and cholinergic synaptic dysfunction. Statins are one of the main cornerstone drugs for the management of cardiovascular disorders regardless of dyslipidemia status. Increasing the use of statins, mainly in the elderly groups for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, may affect their cognitive functions. Extensive and prolonged use of statins may affect cognitive functions in healthy subjects and dementia patients. Statins-induced cognitive impairments in both patients and health providers had been reported according to the post-marketing survey. This survey depends mainly on sporadic cases, and no cognitive measures were used. Evidence from prospective and observational studies gives no robust conclusion regarding the beneficial or detrimental effects of statins on cognitive functions in AD patients.

Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude and decay time of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (male and female APP/PS1 mice) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells in male and female mice with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with &#947;-secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP.

In this context, many studies have addressed the dysregulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs).

To address these questions, we investigated microstructural alterations of two major cholinergic pathways in individuals along the AD continuum using an in vivo model of the human cholinergic system based on neuroimaging.

We modelled the cholinergic white matter pathways with an enhanced diffusion neuroimaging pipeline that included probabilistic fiber-tracking methods and prior anatomical knowledge. The integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was compared between stages of the AD continuum, in the whole cohort and in a CSF amyloid-beta stratified subsample. The discriminative power of the integrity of the pathways was compared to the conventional volumetric measures of hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert, using a receiver operating characteristics analysis. A multivariate model was employed to investigate the role of these pathways in relation to cognitive performance. We found that the integrity of the cholinergic white matter pathways was significantly reduced in all stages of the AD continuum, including individuals with SCD. The differences involved posterior cholinergic white matter in the SCD stage and extended to anterior frontal white matter in MCI and AD dementia stages. Both cholinergic pathways and conventional volumetric measures showed higher predictive power in the more advanced stages of the disease, i.e., MCI and AD dementia. In contrast, the integrity of cholinergic pathways was more informative in distinguishing SCD from healthy controls, as compared with the volumetric measures. The multivariate model revealed a moderate contribution of the cholinergic white matter pathways but not of volumetric measures towards memory tests in the SCD and MCI stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cholinergic white matter pathways are altered already in SCD individuals, preceding the more widespread alterations found in MCI and AD.

We found that pairwise neuron-macrophage interaction would trigger immune responses and attenuate neuron cells' secretion, while neuron-microglia interaction generally results in opposite outcomes in secretion. When neuron cells are induced with A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> protein into the AD model, both neuron-macrophage and neuron-microglia interactions lead to increased cytokines and NDEs and decreased NFs. Further analysis of AD patients' serum showed that NDEs were significantly higher in patients' samples than in the control group, validating our observation from the interaction assay. Furthermore, we resolved previously undifferentiated heterogeneity underlying the secretions from single-neuron cells. We found that the NDE and NF secretion was less dependent on the paracrine signaling between one another and that secretions from neuron cells would attenuate after differentiation with A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>. This study demonstrates the mapping of the different secretomes from paired neuron-immune single cells, providing avenues for understanding how neurons and immune cells interact through the complex secretome network.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Neuronal caspase-1 from inflammasome and cathepsin B are key enzymes mediating neuroinflammation in AD, therefore, revealing new molecules to modulate these enzymes may be an interesting approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we searched for new caspase-1 and cathepsin B inhibitors from five species of Brazilian marine invertebrates (four cnidarians and one echinoderm). The results show that the extract of the box jellyfish <i>Chiropsalmus quadrumanus</i> inhibits caspase-1. This extract was fractionated, and the products monitored for their inhibitory activity, until the obtention of a pure molecule, which was identified as trigonelline by mass spectrometry. Moreover, four extracts inhibit cathepsin B, and <i>Exaiptasia diaphana</i> was selected for subsequent fractionation and characterization, resulting in the identification of betaine as being responsible for the inhibitory action. Both molecules are already found in marine organisms, however, this is the first study showing a potent inhibitory effect on caspase-1 and cathepsin B activities. Therefore, these new prototypes can be considered for the enzyme inhibition and subsequent control of the neuroinflammation.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

However, cellular senescence is characterized by additional changes, such as an irregular cell cycle arrest, and a variety of metabolic and molecular changes including a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, dysfunction of degradation mechanisms, and altered DNA damage response. Here, we tested whether dystrophic microglia display customary markers of cell senescence by performing double and triple staining in sections of the temporal lobe and brain stem from 14 humans. We found that markers related to oxidative damage, such as upregulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and y-H2AX, as well as inclusion of lipofuscin, do not or only exceptionally colocalize with dystrophic microglia. Further, we did not observe a decline in lamin B1 around nuclear laminae in either dystrophic or ramified microglia within the same microscopic field. Only ferritin expression, which is known to increase with aging in CNS microglia, was frequently observed in dystrophic, but rarely in ramified microglial cells. We conclude that neither dystrophic nor ramified microglia in human brain exhibit significant expression of conventional senescence markers associated with oxidative stress, and that ferritin is the dominant immunophenotypic change related to microglial aging. We suggest that multiple pathogenic mechanisms other than those driving cellular senescence contribute to dystrophic transformation of microglia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Methods and Results Using PCSK9 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms from European ancestry-based genome-wide association studies of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (N=1&#8201;320&#8201;016), circulating PCSK9 protein levels (N=10&#8201;186), tissue-specific PCSK9 gene expression, sex-specific genome-wide association studies of anxiety, depression, cognition, insomnia, and dementia (ranging from 54&#8201;321 to 194&#8201;174), we used drug-target inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization (MR) and complementary MR methods (MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode) to investigate potential neuropsychiatric consequences of genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition in men and women. We failed to find evidence surpassing correction for multiple comparisons of relationships between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and the risk for the 12 neuropsychiatric end points in either men or women. Drug-target analyses were generally well-powered to detect effect estimates at several hypothesized thresholds for both combined-sex and sex-specific end points, especially analyses using PCSK9 instruments derived from protein and expression quantitative trait loci. Further, MR estimates across complementary MR methods and additional models using genetic instruments derived from circulating PCSK9 protein levels and tissue-specific <i>PCSK9</i> expression were in alignment, strengthening causal inference. Conclusions Genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition showed a neutral neuropsychiatric side effect profile with no major sex-specific differences. Given statistical power considerations, replication with larger samples, as well as data from other ancestral populations, are necessary. These findings may have important clinical implications for lipid-lowering drug-prescribing practices and side effect monitoring of approved and future PCSK9 therapies.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

To date, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how Abeta42 alters the elementary parameters of GABAergic synaptic function. Here we found that Abeta42 increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature GABAergic currents as well as the amplitude of evoked inhibitory post synaptic currents (eIPSCs). When we focused on paired pulse depression (PPD) to establish whether GABA release probability (p) was affected by Abeta42, we did not observe any significant change. On the other hand, a more detailed investigation of the presynaptic effects induced by Abeta42 by means of multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA) and cumulative amplitude analysis shown an increased size of both the readily releasable pool responsible for synchronous release (RRP<sub>syn</sub> ) and the number of release sites (N). We further explored whether ryanodine receptors (RyRs) contributed to exacerbate these changes by stabilizing the interaction between RyRs and the accessory protein calstabin. We observed that the RyRs calstabin interaction stabilizer S107 restored the synaptic parameters to values comparable to those measured in control conditions. In conclusion, our results clarify the mechanisms of potentiation of GABAergic synapses induced by Abeta42. We further suggest that RyRs are involved in the control of synaptic activity during the early stage of AD onset and that their stabilization could represent a new therapeutical approach for AD treatment. Abstract figure legend Left: pre- and postsynaptic neurons are represented under physiological conditions. At rest, ER membrane contains RyRs in closed state and the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous is shifted towards the asynchronous. Middle: Abeta42 causes calcium dysregulation by targeting RyRs which assume a leaky conformation. Abeta42 potentiates the synchronous release and increases the ratio between the size of RRP synchronous and asynchronous, leaving unaltered the size of RRP total. The number of release sites and the number of GABAergic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are both increased by Abeta42. Right: S107, a RyCal compound, counteracts the effects induced by Abeta42 on GABAergic synapses by stabilizing RyRs in a close conformational configuration, recovering the size of RRP asynchronous and decreasing the number of release sites.

Symptoms eventually become severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is necessary for the development of strategies for AD prevention and/or treatment, and modeling of this pathology is an important step in achieving this goal. &#946;-amyloid peptide (A&#946;) injection is a widely used approach for modeling AD. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the model constructed by injection of A&#946; in combination with a prooxidant cocktail (ferrous sulfate, A&#946;, and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (FAB)) best reflects the natural development of this disease. The relationship between oxidative stress and A&#946; deposition and their respective roles in A&#946;-induced pathology in different animal models of AD have been thoroughly investigated. In the current paper, we compared the effects of A&#946; 1-42 alone with that of A&#946;-associated oxidative stress induced by the FAB cocktail on the neurodegeneration of hippocampal cells in vitro. We constructed a FAB-induced AD model using rat primary hippocampal cells and analyzed the contribution of each compound. The study mainly focused on the prooxidant aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, cellular bioenergetics was assessed and routine metabolic tests were performed to determine the usefulness of this model. The data clearly show that aggregated A&#946;1-42 alone is significantly less toxic to hippocampal cells. Aggregated A&#946; damages neurons, and glial cells proliferate to remove A&#946; from the hippocampus. External prooxidant agents (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) or inhibition of internal antioxidant defense by BSO has more toxic effects on hippocampal cells than aggregated A&#946; alone. Moreover, hippocampal cells fight against A&#946;-induced damage more effectively than against oxidative damage. However, the combination of A&#946; with external oxidative damage and inhibition of internal antioxidant defense is even more toxic, impairs cellular defense systems, and may mimic the late phase of AD-associated cell damage. Our findings strongly indicate a critical role for the combination of A&#946; and oxidative stress in the development of neurodegeneration in vitro.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, in our previous studies, the binary co-amorphous system of andrographolide-oxymatrine (AP-OMT) was found to have obvious recrystallization and poor dissolution behavior. Therefore, in this study, we designed three stable ternary co-amorphous systems to improve the physicochemical properties of the binary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT. The ternary co-amorphous systems were prepared with AP, OMT, and trans-cinnamic acid (CA), p-hydroxycinnamic acid (pHCA), or ferulic acid (FA). Intermolecular hydrogen bonds were confirmed by spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Solubility studies showed that the solubility of the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA was significantly increased compared with that of crystalline AP. Dissolution experiments suggested that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA exhibited better dissolution behavior without significant recrystallization compared to the binary co-amorphous AP-OMT. The stability study confirmed that the ternary co-amorphous system of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA maintained good physical stability in the long term for 18 months. In addition, pharmacological experiments revealed that the ternary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT-CA/pHCA/FA have an excellent safety profile and its anti-Alzheimer's disease effects are significantly improved compared to that of the binary co-amorphous systems of AP-OMT. Moreover, this study also found that reducing the pKa value of low molecular weight co-formers would affect the intermolecular interactions and improve the solubility of drugs in the ternary co-amorphous systems.

Previous studies on the prevalence of cSVD are mostly based on single geographically-defined cohorts in high-income countries. Studies investigating the prevalence of cSVD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expanding but have not been systematically assessed.AimThis study aims to systematically review the prevalence of cSVD in LMICs.ResultsArticles were searched from the Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1st Jan 2000 to 31st March 2022, without language restrictions. Title/abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction were performed by 2-7 independent reviewers. The prevalence of cSVD and study sample size were extracted by pre-defined world regions and health status. The Risk of Bias for Non-randomized Studies tool was used. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022311133). A meta-analysis of proportion was performed to assess the prevalence of different MRI markers of cSVD and a meta-regression was performed to investigate associations between cSVD prevalence and type of study, age, and male: female ratio.Of 2,743 studies identified, 42 spanning 12 global regions were included in the systematic review. Most of the identified studies were from China (n=23). The median prevalence of moderate-to-severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) was 20.5%, 40.5%, and 58.4% in the community, stroke, and dementia groups, respectively. The median prevalence of lacunes was 0.8% and 33.52% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) was 10.7% and 22.4% in the community and stroke groups. The mean prevalence of moderate-to-severe perivascular spaces was 25.0% in the community. Meta-regression analyses showed that the weighted median age (51.4 &#177; 0.0 years old; range: 36.3-80.2) was a significant predictor of the prevalence of moderate-to-severe WMH and lacunes, while the type of study was a significant predictor of the prevalence of CMB. The heterogeneity of studies was high (&gt; 95%). Male participants were overrepresented.ConclusionsThis systematic review and meta-analysis provide data on cSVD prevalence in LMICs and demonstrated the high prevalence of the condition. cSVD research in LMICs is being published at an increasing rate, especially between 2010-2022. More data is particularly needed from Sub-Saharan Africa &amp; Central Europe, Eastern Europe &amp; Central Asia.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, seriously influencing the quality of life and is a global health problem. Many factors affect the onset and development of AD, but specific mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. Most studies investigating AD have focused on neurons and the gray matter in the central nervous system (CNS) but have not led to effective treatments. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on the white matter (WM). Magnetic resonance imaging and pathology studies have shown different degrees of WM abnormality during the progression of AD. Myelin sheaths, the main component of WM in the CNS, wrap and insulate axons to ensure conduction of the rapid action potential and axonal integrity. WM damage is characterized by progressive degeneration of axons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and myelin in one or more areas of the CNS. The contributions of OLs to AD progression have, until recently, been largely overlooked. OLs are integral to myelin production, and the proliferation and differentiation of OLs, an early characteristic of AD, provide a promising target for preclinical diagnosis and treatment. However, despite some progress, the key mechanisms underlying the contributions of OLs to AD remain unclear. Given the heavy burden of medical treatment, a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD is vital. This review comprehensively summarize the results on WM abnormalities in AD and explores the relationship between OL progenitor cells and the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential future research directions are discussed.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright&#169; Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Results from animal and cellular models suggest that FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 may accelerate the aggregation of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptide Ab1-42. Here we examined in-vitro whether NQO1 and its FAD-deficient P187S mutation (NQO1*2) directly interact with Ab1-42 and modify its rate of aggregation. When monitored using the fluorescence of either non-covalent thioflavin T or HiLyte Fluor 647 dye covalently attached to the Ab1-42 peptide, the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42 were markedly more rapid in the presence of NQO1*2 than the wild-type NQO1. Experiments using apo-NQO1 indicate that this increase is linked to the inability of NQO1*2 to bind to FAD. Furthermore, dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor which binds near the FAD binding site and stabilizes NQO1*2, markedly decreased the aggregation kinetics of Ab1-42. Imaging flow cytometry confirmed in-vitro co-aggregation of NQO1 isoforms and Ab1-42. Ab1-42 alone forms rod shaped fibril structures while in the presence of NQO1 isoforms, Ab1-42 is incorporated in the middle of larger globular protein aggregates surrounded by NQO1 molecules. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicates that Ab1-42 interacts with NQO1 isoforms with a specific stoichiometry through a hydrophobic interaction with positive enthalpy and entropy changes. These data define the kinetics, mechanism, and shape of co-aggregates of Ab1-42 and NQO1 isoforms and the potential relevance of FAD-deficient forms of NQO1 for amyloid aggregation diseases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright 2022 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Using a community-engaged research approach, we collaborated with predominately African American serving community-based organizations to support content development and delivery of Aging with Grace (AWG), a culturally tailored ADRD educational curriculum.

Attendees (32%) also perceived an increase in ADRD knowledge from attending AWG and 89.1% believed more African Americans should participate in research. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of a culturally tailored community education program to enhance knowledge, clinical trial interest, and recruitment into observational studies and lifestyle ADRD clinical trials among older African Americans.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">The onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an essential outcome in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) prevention trials and a compelling milestone for clinically meaningful change. Determining MCI, however, may be variable and subject to disagreement. Adjudication procedures may improve the reliability of these determinations. We report the performance of an adjudication committee for an AD prevention trial.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The TOMMORROW prevention trial selected cognitively normal participants at increased genetic risk for AD and randomized them to low-dose pioglitazone or placebo treatment. When adjudication criteria were triggered, a participant\\'s clinical information was randomly assigned to a three-member panel of a six-member independent adjudication committee. Determination of whether or not a participant reached MCI due to AD or AD dementia proceeded through up to three review stages - independent review, collaborative review, and full committee review - requiring a unanimous decision and ratification by the chair.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Of 3494 participants randomized, the committee adjudicated on 648 cases from 386 participants, resulting in 96 primary endpoint events. Most participants had cases that were adjudicated once (n = 235, 60.9%); the rest had cases that were adjudicated multiple times. Cases were evenly distributed among the eight possible three-member panels. Most adjudicated cases (485/648, 74.8%) were decided within the independent review (stage 1); 14.0% required broader collaborative review (stage 2), and 11.1% needed full committee discussion (stage 3). The primary endpoint event decision rate was 39/485 (8.0%) for stage 1, 29/91 (31.9%) for stage 2, and 28/72 (38.9%) for stage 3. Agreement between the primary event outcomes supported by investigators\\' clinical diagnoses and the decisions of the adjudication committee increased from 50% to approximately 93% (after around 100 cases) before settling at 80-90% for the remainder of the study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The adjudication process was designed to provide independent, consistent determinations of the trial endpoints. These outcomes demonstrated the extent of uncertainty among trial investigators and agreement between adjudicators when the transition to MCI due to AD was prospectively assessed. These methods may inform clinical endpoint determination in future AD secondary prevention studies. Reliable, accurate assessment of clinical events is critical for prevention trials and may mean the difference between success and failure.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive manifestation of aging associated with accumulated Amyloid &#946;. It remains frustratingly unclear why this protein accumulates and how it contributes to Alzheimer's Disease pathology. In one recent hypothesis, Amyloid &#946; is suggested to function as an antimicrobial peptide in innate immune defense within the brain, where Amyloid &#946; gains toxicity when it becomes abundant. This essay proposes an evolutionary explanation for why Amyloid &#946; expression is regulated at an optimum based on its function as a defense and how this leads to disease. Among its potential physiological functions, Amyloid &#946; confers benefits to reduce direct pathogen damage while this simultaneously entails cellular cost of defense. Optimal Amyloid &#946; expression occurs when the gain in fitness from an incremental increase is balanced by the marginal cost of this increase. It proposes that natural selection acting upon the young favored systems to maintain Amyloid &#946; at an optimal level through mechanisms that induce the defense and repress its expression. With age, the force of natural selection declines and permits mechanisms of negative feedback repression to degenerate. Consequently, Amyloid &#946; is expressed beyond its optimum. Age also elevates cumulative pathogen exposure, reduces pathogen barriers and reactivates latent pathogens. The net effect is elevated, chronic induction of Amyloid &#946; in the brain. The model recommends attention to innate immune negative regulation in the brain to discover ways to restore these functions toward a youthful state in the elderly.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

This study tested the hypothesis that altered protein levels in blood plasma could serve as biomarkers of NPS; and that altered protein levels are associated with persisting NPS and cognitive decline over time. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in older subjects with cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired in a memory clinic setting. NPS were recorded through the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) while cognitive and functional impairment was assessed using the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SoB) score at baseline and follow-up visits. Shotgun proteomic analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted in blood plasma samples, identifying 420 proteins. The presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology was determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. Eighty-five subjects with a mean age of 70 (&#177;&#8201;7.4) years, 62% female and 54% with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia were included. We found 15 plasma proteins with altered baseline levels in participants with NPS (NPI-Q score &gt;&#8201;0). Adding those 15 proteins to a reference model based on clinical data (age, CDR-SoB) significantly improved the prediction of NPS (from receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) 0.75 to AUC 0.91, p =&#8201;0.004) with a specificity of 89% and a sensitivity of 74%. The identified proteins additionally predicted both persisting NPS and cognitive decline at follow-up visits. The observed associations were independent of the presence of AD pathology. Using proteomics, we identified a panel of specific blood proteins associated with current and future NPS, and related cognitive decline in older people. These findings show the potential of untargeted proteomics to identify blood-based biomarkers of pathological alterations relevant for NPS and related clinical disease progression.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSR&#945;-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSR&#945;-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSR&#945;-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSR&#945; was inversely correlated with amyloid-&#946; plaques and &#946;-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (&lt;0.03&#8197;&#181;l/g&#183;s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSR&#946; that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present data in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brains and an animal model of Alzheimer's disease indicate that defects in the insulin receptor localized at the blood-brain barrier strongly contribute to brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease, in association with &#946;-amyloid pathology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022.

Previous research found that elevated orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid was closely related to the course of AD, and orexin-A treatment could increase amyloid &#946; protein (A&#946;) deposition and aggravate spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, recent research found that dual orexin receptor (OXR) antagonist might affect A&#946; level and cognitive dysfunction in AD, but the effects of OX1R or OX2R alone is unreported until now. Considering that OX1R is highly expressed in the hippocampus and plays important roles in learning and memory, the effects of OX1R in AD cognitive dysfunction and its possible mechanism should be investigated. In the present study, selective OX1R antagonist SB-334867 was used to block OX1R. Then, different behavioral tests were performed to observe the effects of OX1R blockade on cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice exhibited both A&#946; and tau pathology, in vivo electrophysiological recording and western blot were used to investigate the potential mechanism. The results showed that chronic OX1R blockade aggravated the impairments of short-term working memory, long-term spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in 9-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice, increased levels of soluble A&#946; oligomers and p-tau, and decreased PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that the detrimental effects of SB-334867 on cognitive behaviors in 3xTg-AD mice are closely related to the decrease of PSD-95 and depression of in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) caused by increased A&#946; oligomers and p-tau.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Today, there are 26.6 million patients with AD in the world and it is suspected that by 2050 the number of such patients may increase four times. Additionally, PD in different countries is recorded among people above 60-65 years old at a level of 167 to 5703 per 100.000 population. The latest studies have made it possible to formulate the main mechanisms of the &#171;microbiota-gut-brain&#187; axis associated with the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the currently available information on the possible role of the gut microbiota in the AD and PD development. It was shown that oxidative stress is one of the main pathogenetic mechanisms of the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the deposition of lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria and amyloid of microbial origin in the brain tissue of patients with impaired permeability of the intestinal barrier plays an important role in AD. In PD, the synthesis of &#945;-synuclein produced by bacteria and neuroinflammation are of the greatest importance. Knowledge of these mechanisms will allow the development of psychobiotics, which will reduce the risk of neurodegeneration in AD and PD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal deposition of &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Despite the fact that biomarkers and methods of treating AD are currently being actively studied, there is still no therapy that can significantly reduce the progression of this disease. Therefore, the search for therapeutic disease-modifying strategies is becoming increasingly popular. One such strategy is the use of focused ultrasound (FUS) under MRI guidance using a contrast agent (microbubbles). Under the influence of low-intensity FUS, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is temporarily opened, which is the main obstacle to the effective delivery of therapeutic compounds to the brain, imposing dimensional and biochemical restrictions on the passage of molecules. One of the processes associated with AD is BBB dysfunction, and therefore the study of the effects of FUS in patients with AD is of interest. The literature data show the effectiveness of FUS in animal models of AD. The researchers attribute the effectiveness of the method to the fact that exposure to FUS induces the opening of BBB and reduces the number of amyloid plaques. It has also been demonstrated that FUS can facilitate the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain. This allows considering FUS as a new non-invasive method of treatment. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of this method in patients with AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

One of the most significant factors leading to vascular dementia is stroke, which increases the risk of developing dementia by about 2 times. Delayed-onset post-stroke dementia is mainly due to severe small vessel disease, recurrent stroke, or concomitant Alzheimer's disease. Among the many mechanisms involved in the development of vascular cognitive impairment, cerebral small vessel disease is perhaps the most common, contributing to cognitive impairment independent of stroke. An important feature of small vessel disease is its steady progression. The cognitive decline in cerebrovascular disease, including small vessel disease, is also usually gradual and gradual, progresses slowly, and the underlying defect extends to processing speed, complex attention, and fronto-executive functions. Vascular cognitive impairments are quite heterogeneous in nature, while having a negative impact on all major cognitive domains. Patient management should include the earliest possible diagnosis of cognitive impairment and the appointment of timely therapy. One of the drugs that has been successfully used to treat vascular cognitive impairment is nicergoline (Sermion). The clinical efficacy of the drug is achieved due to the improvement of cerebral blood flow, a positive effect on cholinergic neurotransmission and neuroprotective action.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Disagreement about the validity of the field's dominant approach, based on the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, has led to a seemingly unresolvable trench war between proponents and critics. Our paper evaluates the recent scientific literature on AD from a historical and philosophical perspective. We show that AD research is a classic example of the boundary work at play in a field in crisis: both parties deploy historical and philosophical references to illustrate what counts as good and bad science, as proper scientific method and appropriate scientific conduct. We also show that boundary work has proved unable to point a way out of the deadlock and argue that the science system's tools for establishing scientific quality, such as peer review and the grant system, are unlikely to resolve the crisis. Rather, they consolidate the dominant model's position even more. In conclusion, we suggest that some kind of reverse boundary-work is needed that reopens the discussion on the nature of AD, an issue that has never been settled scientifically. Drawing on historical and philosophical work, we make clear that the definition of AD as a biomedical disease for which a cure can be found has consequences, not only for funding opportunities, but also for patients and their lives. A reconsideration of the desirability of these consequences may lead to different choices with respect to research priorities and patient care.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

In this paper, an AD prediction algorithm based on group convolution and a joint loss function is proposed. First, a group convolutional backbone network based on ResNet18 is designed to extract lesion features from multiple channels, which makes the expression ability of the network improved to a great extent. Then, a hybrid attention mechanism is presented, which enables the network to focus on target regions and learn feature weights, so as to enhance the network's learning ability of the lesion regions that are relevant to disease diagnosis. Finally, a joint loss function, that avoids the overfitting phenomenon, increases the generalization of the model, and improves prediction accuracy by adding a regularization loss function to the conventional cross-entropy function, is proposed. Experiments conducted on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset show that the algorithm we proposed gives a prediction accuracy improvement of 2.4% over that of the current AD prediction algorithm, thus proving the effectiveness and availability of the new algorithm.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Jiayuan Cheng et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Herein, three different <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeling strategies and direct radioiodination with <sup>125</sup>I of a bispecific anti-amyloid-beta aducanumab derivate, consisting of aducanumab with a C-terminal fused anti-transferrin receptor binding single chain Fab fragment derived from 8D3 (Adu-8D3), were compared <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> with regard to brain uptake and target engagement in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease mouse model and wild type animals. <b>Methods:</b> Adu-8D3 and a negative control antibody, based on the HIV specific B12 antibody also carrying C-terminal fused 8D3 scFab (B12-8D3), were each conjugated with NCS-DFO, NCS-DFO*, or TFP-<i>N</i>-suc-DFO-Fe-ester, followed by radiolabeling with <sup>89</sup>Zr. <sup>125</sup>I was used as a substitute for <sup>124</sup>I for labeling of both antibodies. 30 &#181;g of radiolabeled mAb, corresponding to approximately 6 MBq <sup>89</sup>Zr or 2.5 MBq <sup>125</sup>I, were injected per mouse.

Evidence suggests that FUS<sup>+MB</sup> is safe, however, the effects of FUS<sup>+MB</sup> on human BBB cells, especially in the context of AD, remain sparsely investigated.

The diversity of lipids in membranes leads to the formation of ordered domains called rafts, which play a crucial role in signal transduction, protein sorting and other cellular processes. Rafts are believed to impact the development of different neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's ones, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, some types of cancer, etc. These diseases correlate with the change in the membrane lipid composition resulting from an oxidative stress, age-related processes, dysfunction of proteins, and many others. In particular, a lot of studies report a significant rise in the level of lysolipids. Physicochemical properties of rafts are determined by membrane composition, in particular, by the content of lysolipids. Lysolipids may thus regulate raft-involving processes. However, the exact mechanism of such regulation is unknown. Although studying rafts <i>in vivo</i> still seems to be rather complicated, liquid-ordered domains are well observed in model systems. In the present study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine how lysophospholipids influence the liquid-ordered domains in model ternary membranes. We demonstrated that even a small amount of lysolipids in a membrane significantly impacts domain size depending on the saturation of the lysolipid hydrocarbon tails and the amount of cholesterol. The mixture with the bigger relative fraction of cholesterol was more susceptible to the action of lysolipids. This data helped us to generalize our previous theoretical model of the domain size regulation by lipids with particular molecular shape expanding it to the case of lysolipids and dioleoylglycerol.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Krasnobaev, Galimzyanov, Akimov and Batishchev.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Evidence suggests that hearing loss (HL), even at mild levels, increases the long-term risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Hearing loss is one of the modifiable risk factors for dementia, with approximately 4 million of the 50 million cases of dementia worldwide possibly attributed to untreated HL. This paper describes four possible mechanisms that have been suggested for the relationship between age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia. The first mechanism suggests mitochondrial dysfunction and altered signal pathways due to aging as a possible link between ARHL and AD. The second mechanism proposes that sensory degradation in hearing impaired people could explain the relationship between ARHL and AD. The occupation of cognitive resource (third) mechanism indicates that the association between ARHL and AD is a result of increased cognitive processing that is required to compensate for the degraded sensory input. The fourth mechanism is an expansion of the third mechanism, i.e., the function and structure interaction involves both cognitive resource occupation (neural activity) and AD pathology as the link between ARHL and AD. Exploring the specific mechanisms that provide the link between ARHL and AD has the potential to lead to innovative ideas for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of AD. This paper also provides insight into the current evidence for the use of hearing treatments as a possible treatment/prevention for AD, and if auditory assessments could provide an avenue for early detection of cognitive impairment associated with AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 &#8211; The authors.

The purpose was to evaluate the general (across tests/domains) and domain-specific PE calculated as the annual rate of change (ARC) in relation to years to the estimated disease onset (YECO) and in four groups of AD: asymptomatic mutation carriers (aAD, <i>n</i> = 19), prodromal, i.e., symptomatic mutation carriers, criteria for AD diagnosis not fulfilled (pAD, <i>n</i> = 4) and mutation carriers diagnosed with AD (dAD, <i>n</i> = 6) as well as mutation non-carriers from the AD families serving as a healthy comparison group (HC, <i>n</i> = 35). Cognition was assessed at baseline and follow-up about 3 years later by 12 tests covering six domains. The aAD and HC groups were comparable at baseline in demographic characteristics (age, gender, and education), when they were in their early forties, while the pAD and dAD groups were older and cognitively impaired. The results on mean ARC for the four groups were significantly different, small, positive, and age-insensitive in the HC group, while ARC was negative and declined with time/disease advancement in AD. The differences between HC and aAD groups in mean ARC and domain-specific ARC were not significant, indicating a subtle PE in aAD in the early preclinical stage of AD. In the symptomatic stages of AD, there was no PE probably due to cognitive disease-related progression. PEs were the largest in the verbal domain in both the HC and aAD groups, indicating a relationship with cognitive vulnerability. The group-related difference in mean ARC was predominant in timekeeping tests. To conclude, the practice effect in over 3 years was suggested to be linked to procedural learning and memory.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Almkvist and Graff.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

To this, we examined repairing effects of Taurine-loading PCL conduits cultured with human endothelial stem cells (hEnSCs) on resected sciatic nerves. PCL/Taurine/Cell conduits transplanted to a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap. Forty-two wistar rats were randomly divided to seven groups: (1) Normal group, (2) Negative control (NC), (3) Positive control (nerve Autograft group), (4) PCL conduits group (PCL), (5) Taurine loaded PCL conduits group (PCL/Taurine), (6) hEnSCs cultured on the PCL conduits (PCL/Cell), (7) hEnSCs cultured on the PCL/Taurine conduits (PCL/Taurine/Cell). Functional recovery of motor and sensory nerves, the action potential of exciting muscle and motor distal latency has seen in PCL/Taurine/Cell conduits. Histological studies showed also remarkable nerve regeneration and obvious bridging has seen in this group.

Molecular chaperone activity of Bri2 BRICHOS has been demonstrated against a range of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Using a combination of thioflavin T fluorescence kinetic assay, atomic force microscopy and immuno electron microscopy we show here that recombinant Bri2 BRICHOS effectively inhibits S100A9 amyloid growth by capping amyloid fibrils. Using ex-vivo neuronal network electrophysiology in mouse brain slices we also show that both native S100A9 and amyloids of S100A9 disrupt cognition-relevant gamma oscillation power and rhythmicity in hippocampal area CA3 in a time- and protein conformation-dependent manner. Both effects were associated with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and were not observed upon TLR4 blockade. Importantly, S100A9 that had co-aggregated with Bri2 BRICHOS did not elicit degradation of gamma oscillations. Taken together, this work provides insights on the potential influence of S100A9 on cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) via gamma oscillation impairment from experimentally-induced gamma oscillations, and further highlights Bri2 BRICHOS as a chaperone against detrimental effects of amyloid self-assembly.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Tauopathy can impair cognitive and motor functions and has been observed in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The aetiology of tauopathy remains mysterious; however, recent studies suggest that the autophagic-endolysosomal function plays an essential role in the degradation and transmission of pathological tau. We previously demonstrated that tetrandrine could ameliorate memory functions and clear amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice by restoring autophagic-endolysosomal function.

In AD, a subpopulation of astrocytes acquires a neurotoxic phenotype which prompts them to lose typical physiological features. While the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown, evidence suggests that myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein may play a role in coordinating these cells' immune responses in AD. Herein, we combined studies in human postmortem samples with a conditional genetic knockout mouse model to investigate the link between MyD88 and astrocytes in AD. In silico analyses of bulk and cell-specific transcriptomic data from human postmortem brains demonstrated an upregulation of MyD88 expression in astrocytes in AD versus non-AD individuals. Proteomic studies revealed an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein in multiple brain regions of AD subjects. These studies also showed that although overall MyD88 steady-state levels were unaffected by AD, this protein was enriched in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Functional studies in mice indicated that the deletion of astrocytic MyD88 protected animals from the acute synaptic toxicity and cognitive impairment caused by the intracerebroventricular administration of &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;). Lastly, unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that loss of astrocytic MyD88 resulted in altered astrocyte reactivity, lower levels of immune-related proteins, and higher expression of synaptic-related proteins in response to A&#946;.

Increasing evidence suggests that aggregating A&#946; drives tau accumulation, a process that involves synaptic degeneration leading to cognitive impairment. Conversely, there is a realization that non-fibrillar (oligomeric) forms of A&#946; mediate toxicity in AD. Fibrillar (filamentous) aggregates of proteins across the spectrum of the primary and secondary tauopathies were the focus of recent structural studies with a filament structure based nosologic classification, but less emphasis was given to non-filamentous co-aggregates of insoluble proteins in the fractions derived from post-mortem human brains. Here, we revisited sarkosyl-soluble and -insoluble extracts to characterize tau and A&#946; species by quantitative targeted mass spectrometric proteomics, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy. AD brain sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were greatly enriched with A&#946;<sub>42</sub> at almost equimolar levels to N-terminal truncated microtubule binding region (MTBR) isoforms of tau with multiple site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). MTBR R3 and R4 tau peptides were most abundant in the sarkosyl-insoluble materials with a 10-fold higher concentration than N-terminal tau peptides. This indicates that the major proportion of the enriched tau was the aggregation prone N-terminal and proline rich region (PRR) of truncated mixed 4R and 3R tau with more 4R than 3R isoforms. High concentration and occupancies of site-specific phosphorylation pT<sub>181</sub> (~&#8201;22 %) and pT<sub>217</sub> (~&#8201;16 %) (key biomarkers of AD) along with other PTMs in the PRR and MTBR indicated a regional susceptibility of PTMs in aggregated tau. Immunogold labelling revealed that tau may exist in globular non-filamentous form (N-terminal intact tau) co-localized with A&#946; in the sarkosyl-insoluble pellets along with tau filaments (N-truncated MTBR tau). Our results suggest a model that A&#946; and tau interact forming globular aggregates, from which filamentous tau and A&#946; emerge. These characterizations contribute towards unravelling the sequence of events which lead to end-stage AD changes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, identifying factors that prevent A&#946; production and administering them before the onset of AD, may be an effective preventive method. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit various health effects on the host and are expected to have protective effects on neurological functions via brain-gut correlation. However, the protective effects of LAB against A&#946; are not well understood. We investigated whether LAB feeding could ameliorate the toxicity of A&#946; peptide accumulation in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans expressing the human A&#946; peptide in neurons or muscle as an AD model. A&#946; expressed in muscle caused myopathy and worm paralysis, while A&#946; in neurons disturbed chemotactic activity. Among 14 screened strains, Lactococcus laudensis (LL) and Pediococcus parvulus (PP) prevented the AD worms from losing their chemotaxis behavior and becoming paralyzed by the A&#946; peptide. Immunostaining and western blotting indicated that A&#946; peptide was significantly suppressed in worms fed these two strains, and binding of the A&#946; to vitellogenin was particularly inhibited. Conversely, the mRNA level of the A&#946; gene did not change between LL- or PP-fed worms and the control. In conclusion, LL and PP alleviate neurotoxicity by inhibiting A&#946; accumulation; AD model worms can be used to screen efficient LAB for AD prevention.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

However, in Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) patients, chronic exposure to A&#946; makes microglia to become exhausted, which reduces their phagocytic activity against A&#946;. Since microglia play an important role in A&#946; clearance, enhancing microglial phagocytic activity against A&#946; is a promising target for AD treatment.

Genotype-based prediction of the phenotype is thus a key challenge for the early diagnosis of AD. Machine learning techniques that have been proposed to address this challenge do not consider known biological interactions between the genes used as input features, thus neglecting important information about the disease mechanisms at play. To mitigate this, we first extracted AD subnetworks from several protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases and labeled these with genotype information (number of missense variants) to make them patient-specific. Next, we trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the patient-specific networks for phenotype prediction. We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status. Nevertheless, our results show that GNNs outperformed other machine learning techniques and that protein-protein interactions lead to superior results compared to randomized networks. These findings highlight that gene interactions are a valuable source of information in predicting disease status.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The best cellular correlates of the early cognitive deficits in AD patients are synapse loss and gliosis. In particular, it is unclear whether the activation of microglia (microgliosis) has a neuroprotective or pathological role early in AD. Here we report that microgliosis is an early mediator of synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of increased amyloidosis. We found that the appearance of microgliosis, synaptic dysfunction and behavioral impairment coincided with increased soluble A&#946;<sub>42</sub> levels, and occurred well before the presence of A&#946; plaques. Inhibition of microglial activity by treatment with minocycline (MC) reduced gliosis, synaptic deficits and cognitive impairments at early pathological stages and was most effective when provided preventive, i.e., before the onset of microgliosis. Interestingly, soluble A&#946; levels or A&#946; plaques deposition were not affected by preventive MC treatment at an early pathological stage (4&#160;months) whereas these were reduced upon treatment at a later stage (6&#160;months). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of early-stage prevention of microgliosis on the development of cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice, which might be clinically relevant in preventing memory loss and delaying AD pathogenesis.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Author(s).

We identified an association of lactosylceramides (LacCer) with AD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>ABCA7</i> (<i>P</i> = 5.0 &#215; 10<sup>-5</sup> to 1.3 &#215; 10<sup>-44</sup>).

Furthermore, activation of microglia increases intracellular concentrations of hexosylceramides in part through induction in the expression of sphingosine kinase, an enzyme with a high control coefficient for sphingolipid and ceramide synthesis. Our work suggests that the risk for AD arising from functional variations in <i>ABCA7</i> is mediated at least in part through ceramides.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that accounts for up to 80% of all dementias. Characterised by deteriorations of memory and cognitive function, the key neuropathological features are accumulations of &#946;-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, as 'plaques' and 'tangles', respectively. Despite extensive study, however, the exact mechanism underlying aggregate formation in Alzheimer's disease remains elusive, as does the contribution of these aggregates to disease progression. Importantly, a recent evaluation of current Alzheimer's disease animal models suggested that rodent models are not able to fully recapitulate the pathological intricacies of the disease as it occurs in humans. Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to species that might make good alternatives to rodents for studying the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The sheep (Ovis aries) is one such species, although to date, there have been few molecular studies relating to Alzheimer's disease in sheep. Here, we investigated the Alzheimer's disease relevant histopathological characteristics of 22 sheep, using anti-&#946;-amyloid (Abcam 12267 and mOC64) and phosphorylation specific anti-tau (AT8 and S396) antibodies. We identified numerous intraneuronal aggregates of both &#946;-amyloid and tau that are consistent with early Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. We confirmed the expression of two 3-repeat (1N3R, 2N3R) and two 4-repeat (1N4R, 2N4R) tau isoforms in the ovine brain, which result from the alternative splicing of two tau exons. Finally, we investigated the phosphorylation status of the serine396 residue in 30 sheep, and report that the phosphorylation of this residue begins in sheep aged as young as 2&#160;years. Together, these data show that sheep exhibit naturally occurring &#946;-amyloid and tau pathologies, that reflect those that occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. This is an important step towards the validation of the sheep as a feasible large animal species in which to model Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

We performed a direct comparison of the FMM-FBB rdcCL method using MRI and CT images to define a common target region and the six regional VOIs of frontal, temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, occipital, and striatal regions.

Both FMM and FBB showed that CT-based rdcCL scales were highly correlated with MRI-based rdcCL scales (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97~0.99). Regarding the absolute difference of rdcCLs between FMM and FBB, the CT-based method was not different from the MRI-based method, globally or regionally (p value = 0.07~0.95). In our clinical validation study, the global negative group showed that the regional positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the regional negative subgroup (p &lt; 0.05). The global positive group also showed that the striatal positive subgroup had worse neuropsychological performance than the striatal negative subgroup (p &lt; 0.05).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our findings suggest that it is feasible to convert regional FMM or FBB rdcSUVR values into rdcCL scales without additional MRI scans.

However, semi-quantitative measures may potentially be affected by changes in blood flow, whereas quantitative measures such as binding potential (BPND) are not. For [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir PET the sensitivity of SUVr for changes in blood flow has not been investigated yet. This is important, because [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir PET is an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Therefore we compared semi-quantitative (SUVr) and quantitative (R1, BPND) parameters of longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir PET scans, and assessed their vulnerability to changes in blood flow. Subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; <i>n</i> = 38) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (<i>n</i> = 24) underwent baseline (BL) and 2-year follow-up (FU) dynamic [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir PET scans. BPND and R1 were estimated using receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and SUVr(80-100min) was calculated. For each region-of-interest ((trans)entorhinal, limbic and neocortical) and parameter, %change was calculated. Regional SUVrs were compared to corresponding DVR (= BPND+1) using paired T-tests. Additionally, simulations were performed to model effects of (large(r)) flow changes on BPND and SUVr in different binding categories. Thereafter, %bias for SUVr with respect to underlying binding and flow were evaluated. Results in SCD and AD showed only minor differences between SUVr and BPND %change. R1 changes were small (+0.7% in SCD and -1.6% in AD). Simulations illustrated a variable %bias for SUVr depending on the underlying binding condition. Concluding, in line with established practices, SUVr provided an accurate estimate of specific binding for [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir over a two-year follow-up during which changes in flow were small, also in AD patients. Notwithstanding, simulations showed that large(r) flow changes may potentially affect [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir SUVr. Given that it is currently unknown to what order of magnitude pharmacotherapeutic interventions may induce changes in cerebral blood flow, caution may be warranted in situations where changes in flow are large(r) and DVR/BPND may be preferred in such conditions to ensure representative quantification of [<sup>18</sup>F]flortaucipir PET images.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Several mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup association studies have suggested that common mtDNA variants are associated with multifactorial diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, such studies have also produced conflicting results. A new mtDNA association model, the 'variant load model' (VLM), has been applied to multiple disease phenotypes. Application of the VLM in a 2017 study failed to find different variant loads in AD patients compared to controls, in two cohorts of European origin. The study also suggested a lower variant load in healthy elderly individuals, but could offer no replicate cohort to support this observation. Here, the VLM is applied to Japanese mtDNA sequences; in doing so, we explored the role of mtDNA variation in AD and ageing in a different global population. Consistent with the previous findings using the VLM in two populations of European origin, we found no evidence for an association between rarer, non-haplogroup associated variation and the development of AD. However, the result in the context of ageing that suggested those with fewer mildly deleterious mutations might undergo healthier ageing, was not replicated. In contrast to our previous study, our present results suggest that those living to advanced old age may harbour more mildly deleterious mtDNA variations. Importantly our analysis showed this finding is not primarily being driven by many rare population variants dispersed across the mtDNA, but by a few more frequent variants with high MutPred scores. It is suggested the variants in question do not exert a mildly deleterious effect in their most frequent haplogroup context.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Behavioral symptoms and cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests were compared, stratified by ADNC severity (low/intermediate vs high). Participants with ADNC and LATE-NC were older, had higher ADNC burden, and had worse cognitive performance than participants with ADNC alone. In the low/intermediate ADNC strata, participants with comorbid LATE-NC had higher prevalence of behavioral symptoms (apathy, disinhibition, agitation, personality change). They also had worsened performance in episodic memory and language/semantic memory. Differences narrowed in the high ADNC strata, with worsened performance in only episodic memory in the comorbid LATE-NC group.

According to CDR, 50 patients were divided into the early AD group and the middle and advanced AD group, with 23 patients in the early AD group and 27 patients in the middle and advanced AD group. Retrospective study was conducted to analyze the general conditions, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) grading, and the metabolic changes of bilateral MRS in the hippocampus of patients in both groups, so did the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living scale (ADL), and other neuropsychological assessment results. Moreover, the comparative analysis was carried out. The results showed that the MTA grade of medial temporal atrophy increased with the progressive severity of the disease in both groups. A statistical test was conducted on the reduction of hippocampal volume in the two groups, and the P was less than 0.05. Therefore, the MTA scale was of great value in the diagnosis and staging of early AD. However, when the diagnosis of early AD was treated by MTA visual evaluation alone, there was 23.8% false negative diagnosis. If the judgment of early AD only depended on the metabolic changes of hippocampus MRS or MR scanning of intracranial structures, it was likely to cause false negative diagnosis. Therefore, the combination of MRS analysis and MR scanning of intracranial structures was favorable for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD.

BACE1 is also a drug target. However, CSF levels may differ between early-stage amyloid plaque formation (A) and later stage downstream tau-tangle pathology (T) and neurodegeneration (N) and may be expressed as an A/T/N stage (e.g. A+/T-/N or A+/T+/N+). Whether BACE1 and neurogranin levels are persistent traits or change with disease progression is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CSF neurogranin and BACE1 concentrations differ between A/T/N stages, whether these change over time and correlate with memory decline. This may have implications for patient selection in future trials. We used CSF markers to determine A/T/N stage using amyloid beta42/40 ratio, p-tau181 and total-tau respectively in predementia Alzheimer's disease cases (<i>n</i> = 176) [including cases that progressed to dementia (<i>n</i> = 10)] and controls (<i>n</i> = 74) from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort. We selected cases at the presumed early (A+/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 86) and late stages (A+/T+/N+, <i>n</i> = 90) of the Alzheimer's disease continuum and controlled with normal markers (A-/T-/N-, <i>n</i> = 74). A subset of subjects in all A/T/N groups underwent repeat CSF sampling at approximately 2-year intervals up to 6 years from baseline. Using linear mixed models, longitudinal measurements of CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in A+/T-/N- and A+/T+/N+ as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls were performed. Next, we measured changes in CSF BACE1 and neurogranin levels in cases that progressed from A-/T-/N- to A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 12), from A+/T-/N- to A+/T or N+ (<i>n</i> = 12), remained stable A+/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 26), remained stable A+/T+/N+ (<i>n</i> = 28) compared with controls remaining stable A-/T-/N- (<i>n</i> = 33). Lastly, associations between these markers and memory decline were assessed. Compared with A-/T-/N- healthy controls, neurogranin was unaltered in A+/T-/N- (n.s.) but higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, BACE1 was lower in A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and higher in A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001). The neurogranin/BACE1 ratio was increased in both A+/T-/N- (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) and A+/T+/N+ (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) groups as compared to A-/T-/N- healthy controls and was more strongly associated with memory decline (b = -0.29, <i>P</i> = 0.0006) than neurogranin (b = -0.20, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and BACE1 (b = -0.13, <i>P</i> = 0.046). Neurogranin and BACE1 level differences remained stable over time not only within A/T/N groups but also in patients progressing to more pathological A/T/N stages (e.g. progressing from A+/T-/N- to A + T or N+) and in cases progressing to dementia. Our results suggest that neurogranin and BACE1 levels may differentiate pathomechanistic Alzheimer's disease subgroups, putatively with different options for treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022.

However, the relationships between protein synthesis deregulation and ER stress/UPR, as well as their role in the altered homeostatic support of Alzheimer's disease (AD) astrocytes remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported that in astrocytic cell lines from 3xTg-AD mice (3Tg-iAstro) protein synthesis was impaired and ER-mitochondria distance was reduced. Here we show that impaired protein synthesis in 3Tg-iAstro is associated with an increase of p-eIF2&#945; and downregulation of GADD34. Although mRNA levels of ER stress/UPR markers were increased two-three-fold, we found neither activation of PERK nor downstream induction of ATF4 protein. Strikingly, the overexpression of a synthetic ER-mitochondrial linker (EML) resulted in a reduced protein synthesis and augmented p-eIF2&#945; without any effect on ER stress/UPR marker genes. In vivo, in hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, reduced protein synthesis, increased p-eIF2&#945; and downregulated GADD34 protein were found, while no increase of p-PERK or ATF4 proteins was observed, suggesting that in AD astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; and impairment of protein synthesis are PERK-independent. Next, we investigated the ability of 3xTg-AD astrocytes to support metabolism and function of other cells of the central nervous system. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from 3Tg-iAstro cells significantly reduced protein synthesis rate in primary hippocampal neurons. When added as a part of pericyte/endothelial cell (EC)/astrocyte 3D co-culture, 3Tg-iAstro, but not WT-iAstro, severely impaired formation and ramification of tubules, the effect, replicated by EML overexpression in WT-iAstro cells. Finally, a chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) rescued protein synthesis, p-eIF2&#945; levels in 3Tg-iAstro cells and tubulogenesis in pericyte/EC/3Tg-iAstro co-culture. Collectively, our results suggest that a PERK-independent, p-eIF2&#945;-associated impairment of protein synthesis compromises astrocytic homeostatic functions, and this may be caused by the altered ER-mitochondria interaction.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

One pathological hallmark of T2D is the toxic accumulation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates. Monomeric hIAPP is a hormone normally co-secreted with insulin. However, increased levels of hIAPP in prediabetic and diabetic patients can lead to the formation of hIAPP protofibrils, which are toxic to &#946; cells. Current therapies fail to address hIAPP aggregation and current screening modalities do not detect it. Using a stabilizing capping protein, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be developed against a previously nonisolatable form of hIAPP protofibrils, which are protofibril specific and do not engage monomeric hIAPP. Shown here are two candidate mAbs that can detect hIAPP protofibrils in serum and hIAPP deposits in pancreatic islets in a mouse model of rapidly progressing T2D. Treatment of diabetic mice with the mAbs delays disease progression and dramatically increases overall survival. These results demonstrate the potential for using novel hIAPP protofibril-specific mAbs as a diagnostic screening tool for early detection of T2D, as well as therapeutically to preserve &#946; cell function and target one of the underlying pathological mechanisms of T2D.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major obstacle in developing specific diagnostic imaging agents for many neurological disorders. In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (A&#946;) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related A&#946; plaque pathology. An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of &lt;1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6&#176;C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A&#946; VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A&#946; plaques at concentrations as low as 0.22 nM. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex, likely because the concentration required for NT-induced hypothermia was lower than the concentration required to produce in situ labeling. These findings reveal an important dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A&#946;-plaques in cortex. Additional methods to assess anti-mTfR VHH BBB transcytosis will need to be developed for anti-mTfR VHH screening and the development of novel MRI molecular contrast agents.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iPSC-microglia) are increasingly used as a model of AD, but the relevance of historical immune stimuli to model AD is unclear. We performed a detailed cross-comparison over time on the effects of combinatory stimulation of iPSC-microglia, and in particular their relevance to AD. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to measure the transcriptional response of iPSC-microglia after 24&#8197;h and 48&#8197;h of stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+interferon gamma (IFN-&#947;), either alone or in combination with ATP&#947;S. We observed a shared core transcriptional response of iPSC-microglia to ATP&#947;S and to LPS+IFN-&#947;, suggestive of a convergent mechanism of action. Across all conditions, we observed a significant overlap, although directional inconsistency to genes that change their expression levels in human microglia from AD patients. Using a data-led approach, we identify a common axis of transcriptomic change across AD genetic mouse models of microglia and show that only LPS provokes a transcriptional response along this axis in mouse microglia and LPS+IFN-&#947; in human iPSC-microglia.

In this systematic review, we summarize findings on structural and functional brain connectivity in DLB, as connectivity measures may offer better insights on how the brain is affected by the spread of the pathology. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, and SCOPUS for relevant articles published up to November 1, 2021. Of 1215 identified records, we selected and systematically reviewed 53 articles that compared connectivity features between patients with DLB and healthy controls. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-positron emission computer tomography, and electroencephalography assessments of patients revealed widespread abnormalities within and across brain networks in DLB. Frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks and their connections to other brain regions featured the most consistent disruptions, which were also associated with core clinical features and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, graph theoretical measures revealed disease-related decreases in local and global network efficiency. This systematic review shows that structural and functional connectivity characteristics in DLB may be particularly valuable at early stages, before overt brain atrophy can be observed.

The tau-mediated disease mechanisms that drive neurodegenerative disease are still unknown. Tau interactome studies are critically important for understanding tauopathy. They reveal the interacting partners that define disease pathways, and the tau interactions present in neuropathological aggregates provide potential insight into the cellular environment and protein interactions present during pathological tau aggregation. Here we provide a combined analysis of 12 tau interactome studies of human brain tissue, human cell culture models and rodent models of disease. Together, these studies identified 2084 proteins that interact with tau in human tissue and 1152 proteins that interact with tau in rodent models of disease. Our combined analysis of the tau interactome revealed consistent enrichment of interactions between tau and proteins involved in RNA binding, ribosome, and proteasome function. Comparison of human and rodent tau interactome studies revealed substantial differences between the two species. We also performed a second analysis to identify the tau interacting proteins that are enriched in neurons containing granulovacuolar degeneration or neurofibrillary tangle pathology. These results revealed a timed dysregulation of tau interactions as pathology develops.

For comparison, we have built a reference model based on the volumes and thickness of previously reported brain regions that are known to be implicated in disease progression. We validate both models on an internal held-out cohort from The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on an external independent cohort from The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). The deep-learning model is accurate, achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 85.12 when distinguishing between cognitive normal subjects and subjects with either MCI or mild Alzheimer's dementia. In the more challenging task of detecting MCI, it achieves an AUC of 62.45. It is also significantly faster than the volume/thickness model in which the volumes and thickness need to be extracted beforehand. The model can also be used to forecast progression: subjects with mild cognitive impairment misclassified as having mild Alzheimer's disease dementia by the model were faster to progress to dementia over time. An analysis of the features learned by the proposed model shows that it relies on a wide range of regions associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The human body is affected by stress in various ways. It promotes inflammation, which affects cardiac health. The autonomic nervous system is activated during mental stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer's disease are common brain stress disorders. Several methods have been used previously to identify stress, for instance, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography and EEG. The EEG identifies the electrical activity in the human brain by applying small electrodes positioned on the scalp of the brain. It is a useful non-invasive method and collects feedback from stress hormones. In addition, it can serve as a reliable tool for measuring stress.

We show that: i) in vitro affinity for the VAChT was 50-fold higher for (-)FBVM (Ki&#160;=&#160;0.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;nM) than for (-)FEOBV (Ki&#160;=&#160;61&#160;&#177;&#160;2.8&#160;nM); ii) in vivo in rats, a higher signal-to-noise specific brain uptake and a lower binding to plasma proteins and peripheral defluorination were obtained for (-)[<sup>18</sup>F]FBVM compared to (-)[<sup>18</sup>F]FEOBV. Our findings demonstrate that (-)[<sup>18</sup>F]FBVM is a highly promising PET imaging tracer which could be sufficiently sensitive to detect in humans the cholinergic denervation that occurs in brain areas having a low density of VAChT such as the cortex and hippocampus.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>The 2-pentadecyl-2-oxazoline (PEA-OXA) is a natural compound with protective action in neuro-inflammation. We have previously shown that PEA-OXA behaves as an &#945;2 adrenergic receptor (&#945;2AR) antagonist and a putative protean agonist on histamine H3 receptors. Recently, neuroinflammation and monoaminergic neurotransmission dysfunction has drawn particular attention in Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathophysiology. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the dual-acting PEA-OXA in an AD-like model in mice. A combined computational and experimental approach was used to evaluate the ability of PEA-OXA to bind &#945;2A-AR subtype, and to investigate the effects of PEA-OXA treatment on neuropathological (behavioural and functional) effects induced by soluble Amyloid &#946; 1-42 (sA&#946;1-42) intracerebroventricular injection. Computational analysis revealed the PEA-OXA ability to bind the &#945;2A-AR, a pharmacological target for AD, in two alternative poses, one overlapping the Na+ binding site. In vivo studies indicated that chronic treatment with PEA-OXA (10&#160;mg/kg, os) restored the cognitive (discriminative and spatial memory) deficits and social impairments induced by sA&#946; injection. Consistently, electrophysiological analysis showed a recovery of the long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (Lateral Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus pathway), while neuroinflammation, i.e., increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and microglia cells density were reduced. These data provide the basis for further investigation of the pro-cognitive aptitude of PEA-OXA by proposing it as an adjuvant in the treatment in AD, for which the available pharmacological approaches remain unsatisfactory. Moreover, this study offers new future direction in research investigating the role of &#945;2AR in neuropsychiatric illness and therapies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals. These results indicate that the BACE1-generated fragment of NCAM2 regulates BACE1 activity by promoting the targeting of BACE1 to Rab11-positive endosomes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. It is known to regulate protein misfolding in a variety of diseases, including inhibition of A<i>&#946;</i> aggregation and NFT formation in AD. As yet, the diagnostic molecular markers of AD remain unclear. Herein, we sought to investigate molecular markers of HSP70 family that can affect diagnosis and treatment in AD through computational analysis. In this study, the intersection between HSP70 family members and immune molecules was taken to screen immune-related HSP70 family genes. Based on the datasets from the NCBI-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we found that the expression levels of HSPA1A and HSPA2 were significantly increased in AD samples, while HSPA8 significantly decreased. Surprisingly, the combination of the 3 hub genes had a good diagnosis of AD via receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Moreover, the clinical value of the 3 hub genes was further assessed by the Spearman correlation analysis with AD-related genes, <i>&#946;</i>-secretase activity, and <i>&#947;</i>-secretase activity. In terms of immune cell infiltration, we showed that the distribution of seven immune cell types (macrophages M2, neutrophils, T cells CD4 memory activated, macrophages M0, NK cells activated, plasma cells, and T cells follicular helper) was associated with the occurrence of AD by CIBERSORT. Furthermore, our data suggested that EP300, MYC, TP53, JUN, CREBBP, and ESR1 might be key transcription factors (TFs) for the 3 hub genes. In general, these findings suggest that HSPA1A, HSPA2, and HSPA8 are potential molecular biomarkers for prognosis among HSP70 family in AD, and it provides a new perspective on diagnostic and therapeutic targets for AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Yeqing Dong et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The interaction of iron accumulation with <i>&#945;</i>-syn and tau was further explored as an essential pathological mechanism of PDD. However, the links and mechanisms between these factors remain unclear. Studies have shown that the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD are closely related to the separation of abnormal phases. Substances such as proteins can form droplets through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under normal physiological conditions and even undergo further liquid-solid phase transitions to form solid aggregates under disease or regulatory disorders, leading to pathological phenomena. By analyzing the existing literature, we propose that LLPS is the crucial mechanism causing abnormal accumulation of <i>&#945;</i>-syn, tau, and other proteins in PDD, and its interaction with iron metabolism disorder is the key factor driving ferroptosis in PDD. Therefore, we believe that LLPS can serve as one of the means to explain the pathological mechanism of PDD. Determining the significance of LLPS in neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD will stimulate interest in research into treatments based on interference with abnormal LLPS.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Mengzhu Li et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Optical coherence tomography or tomographic angiography has been shown to identify retinal thickness loss and lower vascular density present earlier than symptom onset in these patients. The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and shares anatomic and functional similarities with the brain.

In contrast to A&#946;, abnormally phosphorylated &#964; (p-&#964;) can also be found in non-AD tauopathies. In AD, p-&#964; is the main component of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which result from aggregation of abnormally phosphorylated and folded &#964;. In this review, we discuss the role of p-&#964; pathology in Alzheimer's disease considering neuropathological, biochemical, cellular, animal model, and clinical findings. We discuss the relationship between p-&#964; and other AD-related proteins such as A&#946; and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). In light of the current state of knowledge, we conclude that p-&#964; aggregation known as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) may represent a prerequisite for the development of AD rather that a downstream effect of A&#946; toxicity. However, A&#946; as well as TDP-43 pathology appear to accelerate accumulation and propagation of p-&#964; pathology once initiated, ultimately leading to the full-blown picture of AD. In this context, &#964; seeds can induce granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), AD-typical lesions in which the activated necrosome - required for the execution of necroptosis, a programmed form of cell death - can be found. Moreover, necrosome-exhibiting GVD is associated with a decreased neuronal density. Thus, we speculate that p-&#964; pathology is a major driver for neuron loss in AD via GVD-mediated necroptosis. Overall, p-&#964; seems to play a central role in AD as it appears to constitute a prerequisite for AD development which can then be accelerated by co-factors. This would fit in a probabilistic model of AD, in which the presence and severity of the respective co-factors such as A&#946;, TDP-43, and others contribute separately to AD pathogenesis as probabilistic factors with a certain weight.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AD showed significantly higher iron deposition in caudate and putamen with higher spatial variation compared with old adults, pPD and cPD (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01), and significant iron deposition in SN compared with old adults (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.01). Also, linear regression models had significances in predicting motor score in pPD and cPD (R<sub>mean</sub>&#160;=&#160;0.443, P<sub>permutation</sub>&#160;=&#160;0.001) and cognition score in MCI and AD (R<sub>mean</sub>&#160;=&#160;0.243, P<sub>permutation</sub>&#160;=&#160;0.037). In conclusion, progressive iron deposition in the SN and RN may characterize PD-related neurodegeneration, namely aging to cPD through pPD. On the other hand, extreme iron deposition in the caudate and putamen may characterize AD-related neurodegeneration.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

The hypometabolic state associated with chronic thiamine insufficiency (TI) has been demonstrated to be a contributor towards the development of amyloid plaque deposition and neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF1&#945;). Utilizing neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22), TI-induced HIF1&#945; activation triggered the amyloidogenic cascade through transcriptional expression and increased activity of &#946;-secretase (BACE1). Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1&#945; during TI significantly reduced BACE1 and C-terminal Fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) formation. TI also increased the expression of the HIF1&#945; regulated pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19&#160;kDa protein-interacting protein (BNIP3). Correspondingly, cell toxicity during TI conditions was significantly reduced with HIF1&#945; and BNIP3 knockdown. The role of BNIP3 in TI-mediated toxicity was further highlighted by localization of dimeric BNIP3 into the mitochondria and nuclear accumulation of Endonuclease G. Subsequently, TI decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced chromatin fragmentation. However, cell toxicity via the HIF1&#945;/BNIP3 cascade required TI induced oxidative stress. HIF1&#945;, BACE1 and BNIP3 expression was induced in 3xTg-AD mice after TI and administration with the HIF1&#945; inhibitor YC1 significantly attenuated HIF1&#945; and target genes levels in vivo. Overall, these findings demonstrate a critical stress response during TI involving the induction of HIF1&#945; transcriptional activity that directly promotes neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

For decades, research has focused on neuronal degeneration and the disruption to the neural circuits that occurs during disease progression, undervaluing in some extent the alterations to glial cells even though these alterations were described in the very first studies of this disease. In recent years, it has been recognized that different families of neuroglia are not merely support cells for neurons but rather key and active elements in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Alterations to different types of neuroglia (especially astroglia and microglia but also mature oligodendroglia and oligodendroglial progenitors) have been identified in the initial neuropathological changes that lead to dementia, suggesting that they may represent therapeutic targets to prevent neurodegeneration. In this review, based on our own studies and on the relevant scientific literature, we argue that a careful and in-depth study of glial cells will be fundamental to understanding the origin and progression of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we analyze the main issues regarding the neuroprotective and neurotoxic role of neuroglial changes, reactions and/or involutions in both humans with Alzheimer's disease and in experimental models of this condition.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

It starts as a moderate condition affecting areas of the brain that make it challenging to retain recently learned information, causes mood swings, and causes confusion regarding occasions, times, and locations. The most prevalent type of dementia, called Alzheimer's disease (AD), causes memory-related problems in patients. A precise medical diagnosis that correctly classifies AD patients results in better treatment. Currently, the most commonly used classification techniques extract features from longitudinal MRI data before creating a single classifier that performs classification. However, it is difficult to train a reliable classifier to achieve acceptable classification performance due to limited sample size and noise in longitudinal MRI data. Instead of creating a single classifier, we propose an ensemble voting method that generates multiple individual classifier predictions and then combines them to develop a more accurate and reliable classifier. The ensemble voting classifier model performs better in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for older adults than existing methods in important assessment criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. For the binary classification of with dementia and no dementia, an accuracy of 96.4% and an AUC of 97.2% is attained.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice were subjected to 12 weeks of treadmill exercise, followed by spatial memory tests. After the behavioral study, the amyloid (A&#946;) pathology, gut microbes and metabolites, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) displacement, and degree of neuroinflammation were analyzed. We found that this strategy of exercise enriched gut microbial diversity and alleviated neuroinflammation in the brain. Notably, exercise led to reductions in pathogenic bacteria such as intestinal <i>Allobaculum</i>, increases in probiotic bacteria such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, increased levels of intestine-brain barrier proteins, and attenuated LPS displacement.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>The physiological or dietary advantages of germinated grains have been the subject of numerous discussions over the past decade. Around 23 million tons of oats are consumed globally, making up a sizeable portion of the global grain market. Oat seedlings contain more protein, beta-glucan, free amino acids, and phenolic compounds than seeds. The progressive neurodegenerative disorder of Alzheimer's is accompanied by worsening memory and cognitive function. A key indicator of this disorder is the unusual buildup of amyloid-beta protein (or A&#946;) in human brains. In this context, oat seedling extract (OSE) has been identified as a new therapeutic candidate for AD, due to its antioxidant activity and AD-specific mechanism of action. This study directly investigated how OSE affected AD and its impacts by examining the cognitive function and exploring the inflammatory response mechanism. The dried oat seedlings were grounded finely with a grinder, inserted with 50% fermented ethanol 10 times (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>), and extracted by stirring for 10 h at 45 &#176;C. After filtering the extract by 0.22 um filter, some of it was used for UHPLC analysis. The results indicated that the treatment with OSE protects against A&#946;25-35-induced cytotoxicity in BV2 cells. Tg-5Xfad AD mice had strong deposition of A&#946; throughout their brains, while WT mice did not exhibit any such deposition within their brains. A drastic reduction was observed in terms of numbers, as well as the size, of A&#946; plaques within Tg-5Xfad AD mice exposed to OSE. This study indicated OSE's neuroprotective impacts against neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation induced by amyloid-beta. Our results suggest that OSE acts as a neuroprotective agent to combat AD-specific apoptotic cell death, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta accumulation, as well as synaptic dysfunction in AD mice's brains. Furthermore, the study indicated that OSE treatment affects JNK/ERK/p38 MAPK signaling, with considerable inhibition in p-JNK, p-p38, and p-ERK levels seen in the brain of OSE-treated Tg-5Xfad AD mice.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

With the exception of the salts, all the alkaloids were able to chelate ferrous and ferric ions in non-buffered conditions, but only five of them (galanthine, glaucine, corydine, corydaline and tetrahydropalmatine) evoked some significant chelation at pH 7.5 and only the first two were also active at pH 6.8. By contrast, none of the tested alkaloids chelated cuprous or cupric ions. All the alkaloids, with the exception of the protopines, significantly reduced the ferric and cupric ions, with stronger effects on the latter. These effects were mostly dependent on the number of free aromatic hydroxyls, but not other hydroxyl groups. The most potent reductant was boldine. As most of the alkaloids chelated and reduced the ferric ions, additional experimental studies are needed to elucidate the biological relevance of these results, as chelation is expected to block reactive oxygen species formation, while reduction could have the opposite effect.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Moreover, cholesterol transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1) were up-regulated in the cortex after the 27-OHC treatment.

Since there are no effective therapies for any tauopathy, there is a growing need for reliable experimental models that would provide us with better knowledge and understanding of their etiology and identify novel molecular targets. In this review, we will summarize the development of cellular models for modeling tau pathology. We will discuss their different applications and contributions to our current understanding of the \"prion-like\" nature of pathological tau.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

This review delineates how in in vivo models MHDIs suppress A&#946; deposition by downregulating &#946;- and &#947;-secretase activities; inhibit oxidative stress by enhancing the antioxidant activities and reducing lipid peroxidation; prevent tau hyperphosphorylation by upregulating protein phosphatase 2A expression and downregulating glycogen synthase kinase-3&#946; expression; reduce inflammatory mediators partly by upregulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2-mediated signaling and downregulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated signaling; attenuate synaptic dysfunction by increasing presynaptic protein, postsynaptic protein, and acetylcholine levels and preventing acetylcholinesterase activity; and protect against neuronal apoptosis mainly by upregulating Akt/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling and downregulating p38 MAPK/JNK/Bcl-2-associated x protein (Bax)/caspase-3-, Bax/apoptosis-inducing factor-, C/EBP homologous protein/glucose-regulated protein 78-, and autophagy-mediated apoptotic signaling. Therefore, MHDIs listed in this review protect against A&#946;-induced cognitive decline by inhibiting A&#946; accumulation, oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, inflammation, synaptic damage, and neuronal apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus during the early and late AD phases.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Three octogenarians diagnosed with early stage AD participated in 12 dual-task-based music therapy sessions over 6 weeks. Measures of executive functioning and the performance of a bimanual drum tapping task were evaluated before and after the intervention. Improvements in executive functioning were observed for participants A and C. After the intervention, reduced mean synchronization errors were found for the simultaneous tapping condition for all three participants. Although there was variability in the functional changes between participants, it is noteworthy that positive improvements in the elderly patients with early stage AD were obtained following dual-task-based music therapy.

Notable progress in the previous decades has generated many lines of proof arguing that yeast, fungal, and mammalian prions determine heritable as well as infectious traits. The extraordinary phenotypic diversity of human prion diseases arises from structurally distinct prion strains that target, at different progression speeds, variable brain structures and cells.

These disorders, termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), possess neuropathologic similarities to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (A&#946;) peptide aggregates. A&#946; peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1. However, this is precluded by cleavage of APP by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase, ADAM10. Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels. Furthermore, decreases in SIRT1 protein levels were observed at an earlier time point than the decreases in ADAM10 protein levels, and the reduction in SIRT1 was reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132. This study indicates that HIV-associated insults, particularly excitotoxicity, contribute to changes of APP secretases by downregulating levels of ADAM10 and its regulator.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Then we used the portrait as a platform for identifying treatments that could reverse AD dysregulated expression patterns. Enrichment of dysregulated AD genes included multiple processes, ranging from cell adhesion to CNS development. The three most dysregulated genes in the AD portrait were the inositol trisphosphate kinase, ITPKB (upregulated), the astrocyte specific intermediate filament protein, GFAP (upregulated), and the rho GTPase, RHOQ (upregulated). 41 of the top AD dysregulated genes were also identified in a recent human AD GWAS study, including PNOC, C4B, and BCL11A. 42 transcription factors were identified that were both dysregulated in AD and that in turn affect expression of other AD dysregulated genes. Male and female AD portraits were highly congruent. Out of over 250 treatments, three datasets for exercise or activity were identified as the top three theoretical treatments for AD via reversal of large-scale gene expression patterns. Exercise reversed expression patterns of hundreds of AD genes across multiple categories, including cytoskeleton, blood vessel development, mitochondrion, and interferon-stimulated related genes. Exercise also ranked as the best treatment across a majority of individual region-specific AD datasets and meta-analysis AD datasets. Fluoxetine also scored well and a theoretical combination of fluoxetine and exercise reversed 549 AD genes. Other positive treatments included curcumin. Comparisons of the AD portrait to a recent depression portrait revealed a high congruence of downregulated genes in both.

Novel small molecular compound 2JY-OBZ4 is one of structural analogue of Huperzine A (Hup-A), an anti-AD drug in China. In our previous work, 2JY-OBZ4 exhibited potent effects on tau hyperphosphorylation, A&#946; production and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. However, 2JY-OBZ4's anti-AD effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We here reported that 2JY-OBZ4 resisted tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr181 and Ser396 sites in HEK293-hTau cells transfected with GSK-3&#946;, decreased tau phosphorylation via upregulating the activity of PP2A in HEK293-hTau cells and reduced A&#946; production through regulating protein levels of APP cleavage enzymes in N2a-hAPP cells. Meanwhile, we found that 2JY-OBZ4 had no adverse effects on cell viability of mice primary neuron even at high concentration, and ameliorated synaptic loss induced by human oligomeric A&#946;42. 2JY-OBZ4 had moderate AChE inhibitory activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to be 39.48 &#956;g/ml <i>in vitro</i>, which is more than two times higher than Hup-A. Together, 2JY-OBZ4 showed promising therapeutic effects in AD cell models through regulating multiple targets. The research provides a new candidate for the therapeutic development of AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Here, we investigated the effects of aging in T2DM on AD-like pathology using the leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model of T2DM. Our results indicate that adult T2DM mice exhibited impaired spatial acquisition in the Morris water maze (MWM). Morphological analysis showed an age-dependent neuronal loss in the dentate gyrus. We found that astrocyte density was significantly decreased in all regions of the hippocampus in T2DM mice. Our&#160;analysis showed that microglial activation was increased in the CA3 and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in an age-dependent manner in T2DM mice. However, the expression of presynaptic marker protein (synaptophysin) and the postsynaptic marker protein [postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)] was unchanged in the hippocampus of adult T2DM mice. Interestingly, synaptophysin and PSD95 expression significantly decreased in the hippocampus of aged T2DM mice, suggesting an impaired hippocampal synaptic integrity. Cytokine profiling analysis displayed a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in the hippocampus of aged T2DM mice compared with the younger cohort, outlining the role of aging in exacerbating the neuroinflammatory profile in the diabetic state.

Subjective cognitive decline is increasingly recognized as an early symptomatic stage of AD. Dyadic cognitive report, including subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) from a participant and an informant/study partner who knows the participant well, represents an accurate, reliable, and efficient source of data for assessing risk. However, the separate and combined contributions of self- and study partner report, and the dynamic relationship between the two, remains unclear. The Subjective Cognitive Decline Professional Interest Area within the Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment convened a working group focused on dyadic patterns of subjective report. Group members identified aspects of dyadic-report information important to the AD research field, gaps in knowledge, and recommendations. By reviewing existing data on this topic, we found evidence that dyadic measures are associated with objective measures of cognition and provide unique information in preclinical and prodromal AD about disease stage and progression and AD biomarker status. External factors including dyad (participant-study partner pair) relationship and sociocultural factors contribute to these associations. We recommend greater dyad report use in research settings to identify AD risk. Priority areas for future research include (1) elucidation of the contributions of demographic and sociocultural factors, dyad type, and dyad relationship to dyad report; (2) exploration of agreement and discordance between self- and study partner report across the AD syndromic and disease continuum; (3) identification of domains (e.g., memory, executive function, neuropsychiatric) that predict AD risk outcomes and differentiate cognitive impairment due to AD from other impairment; (4) development of best practices for study partner engagement; (5) exploration of study partner report as AD clinical trial endpoints; (6) continued development, validation, and optimization, of study partner report instruments tailored to the goals of the research and population.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

While the majority (&gt;&#8201;90%) of EOAD cases are not caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, they do have a higher heritability (92-100%) than sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD, 70%) (Wingo et al. Arch Neurol. 2012;69:59-64, Fulton-Howard et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2021;99:101.e1-101.e9). Although the endpoint clinicopathological changes, i.e., A&#946; plaques, tau tangles, and cognitive decline, are common across EOAD and LOAD, the disease progression is highly heterogeneous (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). This heterogeneity, leading to temporally distinct age at onset (AAO) and stages of cognitive decline, may be caused by myriad combinations of distinct disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We and others have used transcriptome profiling in AD patient-derived neuron models of autosomal-dominant EOAD and sporadic LOAD to identify disease endotypes (Caldwell et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2020;6:eaba5933,&#160;Mertens et al. Cell Stem Cell. 2021;28:1533-1548.e6, Caldwell et al. Alzheimers Demen. 2022). Further, analyses of large postmortem brain cohorts demonstrate that only one-third of AD patients show hallmark disease endotypes like increased inflammation and decreased synaptic signaling (Neff et al. Sci Adv Am Assoc Adv Sci. 2021;7:eabb5398). Areas of the brain less affected by AD pathology at early disease stages-such as the primary visual cortex-exhibit similar transcriptomic dysregulation as those regions traditionally affected and, therefore, may offer a view into the molecular mechanisms of AD without the associated inflammatory changes and gliosis induced by pathology (Haroutunian et al. Neurobiol Aging. 2009;30:561-73). To this end, we analyzed AD patient samples from the primary visual cortex (19 EOAD, 20 LOAD) using transcriptomic signatures to identify patient clusters and disease endotypes. Interestingly, although the clusters showed distinct combinations and severity of endotypes, each patient cluster contained both EOAD and LOAD cases, suggesting that AAO may not directly correlate with the identity and severity of AD endotypes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

In a large post mortem study, we show that lower brain mitochondrial genome abundance is associated with a greater odds of AD neuropathological change and worse cognitive performance. We hypothesize that lower mitochondrial genome abundance impairs mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby impacting neuronal and glial cell function. However, it remains to be determined if mitochondrial dysfunction causes, mediates, or is a by-product of AD pathogenesis. Additional support for this hypothesis will be generated by linking peripheral blood mitochondrial genome abundance to AD and establishing clinical trials of compounds that upregulate total mitochondrial genome abundance or boost mitochondrial mass.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

If this is the case, we might expect music cues to alleviate AM deficits in clinical disorders. This systematic review examines music-evoked autobiographical memories (MEAMs) in clinical populations, focusing on cognitive characteristics, and whether MEAMs differ from AMs evoked by other stimuli. We identified 15 studies featuring participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), behavioral variant - Frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), acquired brain damage, and depression. We found that music evokes AMs in these disorders, and that familiar music was more likely to evoke AMs. Compared with healthy controls, AD participants had a relative advantage for MEAMs over picture-evoked AMs. People with damage to the medial prefrontal cortex showed preserved access to MEAMs in terms of frequency, but a relative disadvantage regarding the episodic richness for MEAMs, but not for memories cued by pictures, compared to controls. Participants with bv-FTD had fewer AMs evoked after both music and pictures than healthy controls. Across conditions, MEAMs were generally specific and retrieved fast, suggesting little retrieval effort. MEAMs were also positive, except in depression, where as many negative as positive AMs were produced. These findings suggest several underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms of MEAMs, including anxiety reduction, increased fluency, music-evoked emotions, reminiscence, and involuntary retrieval, and that these might be moderated by musical abilities and memory for music. In conclusion, MEAMs appear to be relatively well preserved, especially in AD. This article is categorized under: Psychology &gt; Memory.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

The neuropathological diagnosis is based on the concurrence of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) designated as Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes. However, NFTs develop in the brain decades before the appearance of SPs, and their distribution does not parallel the distribution of SPs. Moreover, NFTs are found in about 85% of individuals at age 65 and around 97% at age 80. SPs occur in 30% at age 65 and 50%-60% at age 80. More than 70 genetic risk factors have been identified in sAD; the encoded proteins modulate cell membranes, synapses, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) overture provides a new concept and definition of brain aging and sAD for further discussion. AD overture proposes that sAD is: (i) a multifactorial and progressive neurodegenerative biological process, (ii) characterized by the early appearance of 3R&#8201;+&#8201;4Rtau NFTs, (iii) later deposition of &#946;-amyloid and SPs, (iv) with particular non-overlapped regional distribution of NFTs and SPs, (v) preceded by or occurring in parallel with molecular changes affecting cell membranes, cytoskeleton, synapses, lipid and protein metabolism, energy metabolism, neuroinflammation, cell cycle, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessels; (vi) accompanied by progressive neuron loss and brain atrophy, (vii) prevalent in human brain aging, and (viii) manifested as pre-clinical AD, and progressing not universally to mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Author.

Based on copper coordination biochemistry, we designed specific copper chelators [tetradentate monoquinolines (TDMQs)] in order to regulate copper homeostasis in the AD brain and inhibit the deleterious oxidative stress catalyzed by copper-A&#946; complexes. We previously reported that TDMQ20, a highly selective copper chelator selected as a drug candidate, was able to extract copper from the Cu-A&#946;<sub>1-16</sub> complex and restore cognitive and behavioral deficits in AD mouse models. For a better understanding of the mechanism of action of TDMQ20, we decided to investigate the change of profile of proteins expressed in 5xFAD mice after an oral treatment of TDMQ20 (dose = 10 mg/kg, once every two days for 3 months, in total 45 times). Clioquinol (CQ), a non-specific chelator, has been used as a comparator. Here, we report the proteomic alterations in the cortex of 5xFAD mice using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) proteomics technology. The results indicated that 178 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) have been identified in the AD mouse group with respect to wild type (WT) animals (AD/WT). After treatment by TDMQ20, 35 DEPs were found common in AD/WT and TDMQ20/AD groups in an opposite change manner (up- or down-regulated, respectively). In addition, among the 35 DEPs mentioned above, 10 common target proteins have been identified in AD/WT, TDMQ20/AD, and CQ/AD groups, among which 3 target proteins were successfully validated by western blot analysis. In particular, the expression levels of ChAT and CHRM4 are significantly increased upon TDMQ20 treatment with respect to 5xFAD mice, while CQ did not significantly change the expression of these proteins. Our study suggests the involvement of the copper chelator TDMQ20 on the cholinergic system, a feature that may explain the improved cognitive and behavioral performance in AD mice upon oral treatment of TDMQ20.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Biomarkers allow for earlier and more accurate differential diagnosis, and are recommended by the Swiss Memory Clinics as an additional investigation based upon individual indication. Information and counselling are needed both before and after biomarker-supported diagnosis. The procedures for diagnostic lumbar punctures and pre-analytical sample handling should follow published recommendations. The results must be interpreted in the context of the other available history and assessment outcome. Thanks to recent research progress, blood-based biomarkers and other non-invasive markers are expected to become available for clinical practice in the near future. This trend will likely lead to a much broader utilisation of biomarkers and may accelerate the development of effective and individually tailored prevention and treatment approaches.

We sought to understand the differences in neuronal SEV miRNA expression between frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy aging. Plasma was obtained from FTD, AD, and healthy aging participants that were matched based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Additionally, a subset of participants also provided paired cerebrospinal fluid samples to compare neuronal SEV miRNAs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuronal SEV were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation and antibody conjugated Dynabeads&#174; for the neuronal surface marker, L1CAM. RNA sequencing was performed. 12 FTD, 11 with AD, and 10 healthy aging participants were enrolled in the study. In FTD, SEV miRNA-181c was downregulated compared to healthy controls. In AD, miRNA-122 and miRNA-3591 were downregulated compared to those in healthy controls and FTD. Using an FDR &lt;0.2, only miRNA-21-5p was found to have increased expression in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to plasma in a group of AD and FTD participants. SEV miRNA-181c is significantly downregulated in FTD compared to healthy controls and may mediate its effects through microglial-directed neuroinflammation and interaction with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) based on pathway analysis. Additionally, the FOXO and Hippo pathways may be important mediators of FTD, based on pathway analysis. Lastly, because only one SEV miRNA was differentially expressed between the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in paired samples, plasma represents an appropriate biofluid for studying neuronal SEV miRNA.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 the Author(s).

We hypothesized that this relationship is compromised in APOE4 mice considering the differences in fatty acid metabolism between APOE3 and APOE4 mice.

ST showed that the TC were more similar between the moxibustion and control groups. Moxibustion enhanced the number of ligand - receptor pairs between astrocytes and neurons. And the score of interaction intensity and the proportion of interaction were also increased. Meanwhile, the energy of astrocytes and neurons was significantly altered. Additionally, moxibustion could significantly improve the function of CD38 and its ligand Pecam1 which were previously reported having the function of transporting mitochondria from astrocytes to neurons, and then providing energy for neurons.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"SIGNIFICANCE\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our study provides new evidences for the use of moxibustion to increase the \"astrocyte - neuron\" interaction thus to enhance synaptic plasticity of APP/PS1 mice.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

Molecular dynamics simulations can offer information on intermolecular interaction mechanisms between A&#946; protofibrils and A&#946; fibrillization inhibitors. Here, in this work, we explore the early molecular mechanisms of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and apigenin on disrupting A&#946;42 protofibrils based on molecular simulations. The binding modes of EGCG and apigenin with the A&#946;42 protofibril are obtained. Furthermore, we compare the behavioral mechanisms of EGCG and apigenin on disturbing the A&#946;42 protofibril. Both EGCG and apigenin are able to decrease the proportion of the &#946;-sheet and bend structures of the A&#946;42 protofibril while inducing random coil structures. The results of hydrogen bonds and D23-K28 salt bridges illustrate that EGCG and apigenin have the ability of destabilizing the A&#946;42 protofibril. Meanwhile, the van der Waals interactions between the EGCG and A&#946;42 protofibril are shown to be larger than that of apigenin with the A&#946;42 protofibril, but the electrostatic interactions between apigenin and the A&#946;42 protofibril are dominant in the binding affinity. Our findings may help in designing effective drug candidates for disordering the A&#946; protofibril and impeding A&#946; fibrillization.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

It first seemed like the SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily caused a serious respiratory syndrome. However, over the last years, an increasing number of studies also pointed towards the damaging effects of this infection has on the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, evidence suggests a possible disruption of the blood-brain barrier and deleterious effects on the CNS, especially in patients who already suffer from other pathologies, such as neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanisms behind these effects on the CNS could involve the dysregulation of mitochondrial physiology, a well-known early marker of neurodegeneration and a hallmark of aging. Moreover, mitochondria are involved in the activation of the inflammatory response, which has also been broadly described in the CNS in COVID-19.

Genetic loss of or decreased TREM2 function impairs the microglial response to amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) plaques, resulting in more diffuse A&#946; plaques and increased peri-plaque neuritic dystrophy and AD-tau seeding. Thus, microglia and TREM2 are at a critical intersection of A&#946; and tau pathologies in AD. Since genetically decreasing TREM2 function increases A&#946;-induced tau seeding, we hypothesized that chronically increasing TREM2 signaling would decrease amyloid-induced tau-seeding and spreading. Using a mouse model of amyloidosis in which AD-tau is injected into the brain to induce A&#946;-dependent tau seeding/spreading, we found that chronic administration of an activating TREM2 antibody increases peri-plaque microglial activation but surprisingly increases peri-plaque NP-tau pathology and neuritic dystrophy, without altering A&#946; plaque burden.

Currently, our lack of understanding of the complex pathological mechanisms of the disease has led to a high failure rate in the generation of anti-AD food-derived peptides.

Early detection of altered synaptic transmission and insight into mechanisms causing early synaptic alterations would be valuable treatment strategies. This study aimed to investigate how whole-brain networks are influenced at pre- and early-plague stages of AD and if these manifestations are associated with concomitant cellular and synaptic deficits.&#160; METHODS: To this end, we used an established AD rat model (TgF344-AD) and employed resting state functional MRI and quasi-periodic pattern (QPP) analysis, a method to detect recurrent spatiotemporal motifs of brain activity, in parallel with state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry in selected brain regions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">At the pre-plaque stage, QPPs in TgF344-AD rats showed decreased activity of the basal forebrain (BFB) and the default mode-like network. Histological analyses revealed increased astrocyte abundance restricted to the BFB, in the absence of amyloid plaques, tauopathy, and alterations in a number of cholinergic, gaba-ergic, and glutamatergic synapses. During the early-plaque stage, when mild amyloid-beta (A&#946;) accumulation was observed in the cortex and hippocampus, QPPs in the TgF344-AD rats normalized suggesting the activation of compensatory mechanisms during this early disease progression period. Interestingly, astrogliosis observed in the BFB at the pre-plaque stage was absent at the early-plaque stage. Moreover, altered excitatory/inhibitory balance was observed in cortical regions belonging to the default mode-like network. In wild-type rats, at both time points, peak activity in the BFB preceded peak activity in other brain regions-indicating its modulatory role during QPPs. However, this pattern was eliminated in TgF344-AD suggesting that alterations in BFB-directed neuromodulation have a pronounced impact in network function in AD.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">This study demonstrates the value of rsfMRI and advanced network analysis methods to detect early alterations in BFB function in AD, which could aid early diagnosis and intervention in AD. Restoring the global synaptic transmission, possibly by modulating astrogliosis in the BFB, might be a promising therapeutic strategy to restore brain network function and delay the onset of symptoms in AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

In this context, animal models that progressively display AD pathological hallmarks (e.g. TgF344-AD) become crucial. Translational technologies, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), enable the longitudinal metabolic characterization of this disease. However, an integrative approach is required to unravel the complex metabolic changes underlying AD progression, from early to advanced stages. TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) rats were studied in vivo on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, for longitudinal quantitative assessment of brain metabolic profile changes using MRS. Disease progression was investigated at 4 time points, from 9 to 18&#160;months of age, and in 4 regions: cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Compared to WT, TgF344-AD rats replicated common findings in AD patients, including decreased N-acetylaspartate in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, and decreased glutamate in the thalamus and striatum. Different longitudinal evolution of metabolic concentration was observed between TgF344-AD and WT groups. Namely, age-dependent trajectories differed between groups for creatine in the cortex and thalamus and for taurine in cortex, with significant decreases in Tg344-AD animals; whereas myo-inositol in the thalamus and striatum showed greater increase along time in the WT group. Additional analysis revealed divergent intra- and inter-regional metabolic coupling in each group. Thus, in cortex, strong couplings of N-acetylaspartate and creatine with myo-inositol in WT, but with taurine in TgF344-AD rats were observed; whereas in the hippocampus, myo-inositol, taurine and choline compounds levels were highly correlated in WT but not in TgF344-AD animals. Furthermore, specific cortex-hippocampus-striatum metabolic crosstalks were found for taurine levels in the WT group but for myo-inositol levels in the TgF344-AD rats. With a systems biology perspective of metabolic changes in AD pathology, our results shed light into the complex spatio-temporal metabolic rewiring in this disease, reported here for the first time. Age- and tissue-dependent imbalances between myo-inositol, taurine and other metabolites, such as creatine, unveil their role in disease progression, while pointing to the inadequacy of the latter as an internal reference for quantification.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

There are several genes have been found to relate to AD, including the human-specific Notch2 N terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. The CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been reported in clinically diagnosed AD patients. However, it has not been reported in pathologically confirmed AD cases. In this study, we detected the NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion in pathologically confirmed AD brain samples by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR). As a result, the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was validated in one out of 39 pathologically confirmed AD cases. Pathologically, p62 positive intranuclear inclusions were observed in wide brain areas, and most inclusions appeared to be presented in the glial cells. In summary, our study found that the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with pathologically confirmed AD. The p62-positive intranuclear inclusions could co-exist with AD neuropathologic changes.

The patients were grouped according to cognitive impairment (CI) profile and severity: (A) no CI, single-domain amnestic CI, multiple-domain amnestic CI, and nonamnestic CI; and (B) mild CI, moderate and severe dementia. An adapted Framingham Stroke Risk Profile was calculated for each individual. Depression and parkinsonism were also recorded. Standardized quantitative analysis software was used to obtain standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values from PET/CT images. The corresponding associations were assessed with the most appropriate statistical tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">One hundred twenty-nine patients were included (62 men, 67 women; 64.67 &#177; 7.47 years old). Significant differences in global and regional amyloid load were exclusively found in women between non-CI and moderate dementia ( P = 0.006, for total-cerebellum SUVR). Posterior and anterior cingulates and prefrontal cortex best represented CI severity ( P = 0.003, 0.006, and 0.006, respectively). No relationship between the CI profile and the regional amyloid load was shown. A significantly high positive correlation was found between age and vascular risk and between these variables and amyloid load in nearly all regions, especially in women with moderate dementia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Semiquantitative analysis of amyloid PET by SUVR values revealed a significant correlation between amyloid burden and CI severity, although only in women.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches and regulatory mechanisms of protein quality control need to be further evaluated and dissected. The lysosome is one of the major degradative organelles that maintain cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. In our recent study, we have identified a group of LYsosome-Enhancing Compounds (LYECs), which significantly promote the activation of TFEB (transcription factor EB) and lysosome biogenesis via inhibiting dopamine transporters (DAT). Injection of LH2-051, a member of the LYECs identified in this study, significantly improves learning, memory, and cognitive function of APP-PSEN1 mice, in which the enhanced capability of lysosomal degradation promotes the clearance of amyloid protein aggregates. In summary, this study reports novel mechanisms of neurotransporter-mediated lysosome biogenesis and shows that DAT inhibition can alleviate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The datasets GSE15222 and GSE138260 were combined as a training group to build a model, and GSE122063 was used as a test group to verify the model's accuracy. The genes with differential expression found in the combined datasets were used for analysis through Gene Ontology (GO) and The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome Pathways (KEGG). Then, AD-related module genes were identified using the combined dataset through a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Both the differential and AD-related module genes were intersected to obtain AD key genes. These genes were first filtered through LASSO regression and then AD-related feature genes were obtained for subsequent immune-related analysis. A comprehensive analysis of three AD-related datasets in the GEO database revealed 111 common differential AD genes. In the GO analysis, the more prominent terms were cognition and learning or memory. The KEGG analysis showed that these differential genes were enriched not only in In the KEGG analysis, but also in three other pathways: neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cAMP signaling pathway, and Calcium signaling pathway. Three AD-related feature genes (SST, MLIP, HSPB3) were finally identified. The area under the ROC curve of these AD-related feature genes was greater than 0.7 in both the training and the test groups. Finally, an immune-related analysis of these genes was performed. The finding of AD-related feature genes (SST, MLIP, HSPB3) could help predict the onset and progression of the disease.

Long-term hormone disorder can have a direct detrimental effect on the brain by producing an AD-like pathology and result in cognitive decline by impairing neuronal metabolism, plasticity and survival.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT with a limited treatment duration in AD.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We developed a Markov state-transition model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical DMT plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone among Americans living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD. AD states included MCI due to AD, mild AD, moderate AD, severe AD, and death. A hypothetical DMT was assumed to confer a 30% reduction in progression from MCI and mild AD. The base case annual drug acquisition cost was assumed to be $56,000. Other medical and indirect costs were obtained from published literature or list prices. Utilities for patients and caregivers were obtained from the published literature and varied by AD state and care setting (community care or long-term care). We considered 3 DMT treatment strategies: (1) treatment administered until patients reached severe AD (continuous strategy), (2) treatment administered for a maximum duration of 18 months or when patients reached severe AD (fixed-duration strategy), and (3) 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months because of amyloid plaque clearance and the remaining patients continuing treatment until 18 months or until they reached severe AD (test-and-discontinue strategy). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"FINDINGS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">From the health care sector perspective, continuous treatment with a hypothetical DMT versus BSC resulted in an ICER of $612,354 per QALY gained. The ICER decreased to $157,288 per QALY gained in the fixed-duration strategy, driven by large reductions in treatment costs. With 40% of patients discontinuing treatment at 6 months (test-and-discontinue strategy), the ICER was $125,631 per QALY gained. In sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER was the most sensitive to changes in treatment efficacy, treatment cost, and the initial population AD state distribution. From the modified societal perspective, ICERs were 6.3%, 20.4%, and 25.1% lower than those from the health care sector perspective for the continuous, fixed-duration, and test-and-discontinue strategies, respectively.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"IMPLICATIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Under a set of assumptions for annual treatment costs and the magnitude and duration of treatment efficacy, DMTs used for a limited duration may deliver value consistent with accepted US cost-effectiveness thresholds.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Eli Lilly and Company.

DPP6-KO mice are impaired in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and exhibit smaller brain size. Recently, we have described novel structures in hippocampal area CA1 in aging mice, apparently derived from degenerating presynaptic terminals, that are significantly more prevalent in DPP6-KO mice compared to WT mice of the same age and that these structures were observed earlier in development in DPP6-KO mice. These novel structures appear as clusters of large puncta that colocalize NeuN, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A, and also partially label for MAP2, amyloid &#946;, APP, &#945;-synuclein, and phosphorylated tau, with synapsin-1 and VGluT1 labeling on their periphery. In this current study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we confirm that both APP and amyloid &#946; are prevalent in these structures; and we show with immunofluorescence the presence of similar structures in humans with Alzheimer's disease. Here we also found evidence that aging DPP6-KO mutants show additional changes related to Alzheimer's disease. We used in vivo MRI to show reduced size of the DPP6-KO brain and hippocampus. Aging DPP6-KO hippocampi contained fewer total neurons and greater neuron death and had diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease present including accumulation of amyloid &#946; and APP and increase in expression of hyper-phosphorylated tau. The amyloid &#946; and phosphorylated tau pathologies were associated with neuroinflammation characterized by increases in microglia and astrocytes. And levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines increased in aging DPP6-KO mice. We finally show that aging DPP6-KO mice display circadian dysfunction, a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Together these results indicate that aging DPP6-KO mice show symptoms of enhanced neurodegeneration reminiscent of dementia associated with a novel structure resulting from synapse loss and neuronal death. This study continues our laboratory's work in discerning the function of DPP6 and here provides compelling evidence of a direct role of DPP6 in Alzheimer's disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier Inc.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Clinical, demographical, ophthalmological and OCT-A data from the Neuro-ophthalmology Research at Fundaci&#243; ACE (NORFACE) project were analyzed.

Predicting AD progression will clinically help improve diagnosis and empower sufferers in taking proactive care.

In this study, we consider a flexible yet more challenging scenario in which individuals may suffer from the (arbitrary) modality-missing issue, as well as the number of individuals' historical visits and the length of target score trajectories being not prespecified. To address this problem, a multi-modal sequence learning framework, highlighted by deep latent representation collaborated sequence learning strategy, is proposed to flexibly handle the incomplete variable-length longitudinal multi-modal data. Specifically, the proposed framework first employs a deep multi-modality fusion module that automatically captures complementary information for each individual with incomplete multi-modality data. A comprehensive representation is thus learned and fed into a sequence learning module to model AD progression. In addition, both the multi-modality fusion module and sequence learning module are collaboratively trained to further promote the performance of AD progression prediction.

Although the subgroup analysis suggested that inhibition of tau posttranslational modifications is statistically effective and generally safer because of reduced dropouts due to AEs, the analysis has limited credibility. Additional large-scale and well-designed randomized and placebo-controlled trials will be necessary to explore the benefit of a certain type of anti-tau drug for AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The American Geriatrics Society.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Interlink between insulin signaling and AD highlighted the involvement of the IRS/PI3K/Akt/AMPK signaling, and GLUTs in the disease progression. While shedding light on the mitochondrial dysfunction in the defective glucose metabolism, we further assessed functional consequences of AGEs (advanced glycation end products) accumulation, polyol activation, and other contributing factors including terminal respiration, ROS (reactive oxygen species), mitochondrial permeability, PINK1/parkin defects, lysosome-mitochondrial crosstalk, and autophagy/mitophagy. Combined with the classic plaque and tangle pathologies, glucose hypometabolism with acquired insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction potentiate these factors to exacerbate AD pathology. To this end, we further reviewed AD and DM (diabetes mellitus) crosstalk in disease progression. Taken together, the present work discusses the emerging role of altered glucose metabolism, contributing impact of insulin signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the defective cerebral glucose utilization in AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The serum metabolome refers to a set of small-molecules which are an important determinant of cellular health. We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for serum concentrations of 376 metabolites which were population matched with 2 GWAS studies of AD. For each metabolite we performed 2-sample MR (2SMR) using an inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimate for significance testing. After Bonferroni multiple testing correction one metabolite was causally linked to AD in both GWAS: serum urate. This result was supported by robust 2SMR measures and sensitivity analyses. We applied 2SMR to test for a causal relationship between serum urate and other neurodegenerative diseases: Parkinson disease (PD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS but not PD we identified a nominally significant link between serum urate and disease-risk, although in this case increased serum urate was protective. We conclude that serum urate is a modulator of risk for neurodegeneration.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Age, genetics, and chromosomal sex have been identified as critical risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The predominant genetic risk factor for LOAD is the apolipoprotein E <i>&#949;4</i> allele (<i>APOE4</i>), and the prevalence of LOAD is higher in females. However, the translational validity of <i>APOE4</i> mouse models for AD-related cognitive impairment remains to be fully determined. The present study investigated the role of both sex and genotype on learning and memory in aged, humanized <i>APOE</i> knock-in mice. Aged (23.27 mo &#177; 1.21 mo; 39 male/37 female) <i>APOE3/3</i>, <i>APOE3/4</i>, and <i>APOE4/4</i> mice performed a novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Task-related metrics were analyzed using two-way sex by genotype ANOVAs. Sex differences were more prominent relative to <i>APOE</i> genotype. Prior to NOR, female mice exhibited thigmotaxic center zone avoidance during the open field task relative to males, regardless of genotype. Within object familiarization and NOR tasks, females had greater object interaction and locomotion. Interestingly, only <i>APOE4/4</i> females on average recognized the novel object. These results suggest that <i>APOE4</i>, although strongly related to LOAD pathogenesis, does not drive cognitive decline in the absence of other risk factors even in very aged mice. Chromosomal sex is a key driver of behavioral phenotypes and thus is a critical variable for translatability of interventions designed to preserve learning and memory in animal models of LOAD. Last, there was a very high degree of variability in behavioral performance across <i>APOE</i> genotypes. A cluster analysis of the behavioral data revealed a low-activity and a high-activity cluster. <i>APOE4</i> carriers were overrepresented in the low-activity cluster, while male:female distributions did not differ. Collectively, the behavioral data indicate that chromosomal sex has the greatest impact on behavioral phenotype, and <i>APOE4</i> carrier status may confer greater risk for cognitive decline in some animals.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 McLean et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

To identify neuroimaging markers of AD, against which former NFL players would be compared, we conducted a whole-brain volumetric analysis using a cohort of AD patients (ADNI clinical database) to produce a set of brain regions demonstrating sensitivity to early AD pathology (i.e., the \"AD fingerprint\").

The logopenic variant, characterized by impairments of word retrieval and sentence repetition along with preserved semantic, syntactic, and motor speech abilities, is the most recently described and remains less understood than other variants due to a comparatively small number of case studies and a lack of investigations with a thorough specification. In this article, we report a 2-year follow-up case study of a 74-year-old Chinese female patient with a logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, including its neurolinguistic study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B-Positron emission tomography imaging analyses, as well as gene sequencing. This case confirms that, in addition to word-finding and sentence repetition difficulties, the logopenic variant may also present with mild auditory comprehension and naming deficits attributed to impaired access to lexical representations. The observation of clinical treatment suggests the efficacy of memantine hydrochloride tablet and rivastigmine transdermal patch in slowing down the cognitive deterioration of this patient.

Response to AChEI seems associated with correlates of cholinergic deficit (hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, substantia innominate atrophy) and preserved cholinergic neurons (faster alpha on REM sleep EEG, increased anterior frontal and parietal lobe perfusion after donepezil); white matter hyperintensities in the cholinergic pathways have shown inconsistent results. The K-variant of butyrylcholinesterase may correlate with better response in late stages of disease, while the role of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the cholinergic system is controversial. Factors related to drug availability may influence response; in particular, low serum albumin (for donepezil), CYP2D6 variants associated with reduced enzymatic activity and higher drug doses are the most consistent predictors, while AChEI concentration influence on clinical outcomes is debatable. Other predictors of response include faster disease progression, lower serum cholesterol, preserved medial temporal lobes, apathy, absence of concomitant diseases, and absence of antipsychotics. Short-term response may predict subsequent cognitive response, while higher education might correlate with short-term good response (months), and long-term poor response (years).

Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of HK2 significantly promotes microglial phagocytosis, lowers the amyloid plaque burden and attenuates cognitive impairment in male AD mice. Notably, the ATP level is dramatically increased in HK2-deficient or inactive microglia, which can be attributed to a marked upregulation in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression and subsequent increase in lipid metabolism. We further show that two downstream metabolites of HK2, glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate, can reverse HK2-deficiency-induced upregulation of LPL, thus supporting ATP production and microglial phagocytosis.

Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the &#223;2-adrenergic receptor (&#223;2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; &#223;2-agAAb) and is linked to an elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the &#223;2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against &#223;2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (A&#223;) monomers were tested (A&#223;1-14, A&#223;10-25, A&#946;10-37 A&#223;1-40, A&#223;1-42, A&#946;28-40, and A&#223;-[Pyr]3-43). Our results demonstrate that none of the short-chain A&#223; (A&#223;1-14, A&#223;10-25, or A&#946;28-40) showed any agonistic or inhibitory effect on &#223;2-AR. Contrary, long-chain A&#223;-[Pyr]3-43, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that after blocking by the &#223;2-AR antagonist ICI118.551, could be identified as that the effect was realized via the &#223;2-AR. Moreover, the long chain A&#223;1-40, A&#946;1-42, and A&#946;10-37, yet not the short-chain A&#223; peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the &#223;2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the &#223;2-AR, like the &#223;2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer's Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the &#223;2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

This review highlights the effect of carrying the apolipoprotein E &#949;4 allele (APOE4) on various brain cell types in promoting an unresolved inflammatory state. Among its pleotropic effects on brain lipids, we focus on APOE4's activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and its effects on arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid signaling cascades in the brain. During the process of neurodegeneration, various brain cell types, such as astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, together with the neurovascular unit, develop distinct inflammatory phenotypes that impact their functions and have characteristic lipidomic fingerprints. We propose that lipidomic phenotyping of single cell-types harvested from brains differing by age, sex, disease severity stage, and dietary and genetic backgrounds can be employed to probe mechanisms of neurodegeneration. A better understanding of the brain cellular inflammatory/lipidomic response promises to guide the development of nutritional and drug interventions for AD dementia.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Det er en progredierende nethindesygdom som gradvist f&#248;rer til &#248;delaeggelse af de celler som er ansvarlige for vores centralsyn. De tidlige stadier er ofte asymptomatiske, imens senstadie AMD, som opdeles i to former, neovaskulaer AMD (nAMD) og geografisk atrofi (GA), begge udviser gradvist synstab, dog generelt med forskellig hastighed. Tidlig AMD er karakteriseret ved tilstedevaerelsen af druser og pigmentforandringer i nethinden mens nAMD og GA udviser henholdsvis karnydannelse i og atrofi af nethinden. AEtiologien er multifaktoriel og udover alder omfatter patogenesen milj&#248;- og genetiske risikofaktorer. Forskning har specielt fokuseret p&#229; lokale forandringer i &#248;jet hvor man har fundet at inflammation spiller en betydelig rolle for udviklingen af sygdommen, men flere studier tyder ogs&#229; p&#229; at systemiske forandringer og specielt systemisk inflammation spiller en vaesentlig rolle i patogenesen. De Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasier (MPNs) er en gruppe af haematologiske kraeftsygdomme med en erhvervet genetisk defekt i den tidlige pluripotente stamcelle som medf&#248;rer en overproduktion af en eller flere af blodets modne celler. Sygdommene er fundet at udvikle sig i et biologisk kontinuum fra tidligt cancerstadie, essentiel trombocytose (ET) over polycytaemi vera (PV) og endelig til det sene myelofibrose stadie (PMF). Symptomer hos disse patienter skyldes isaer den aendrede sammensaetning af blodet, hyperviskositet, kompromitteret mikrocirkulation og nedsat vaevsgennembl&#248;dning. Den &#248;gede morbiditet og mortalitet beror i h&#248;j grad p&#229; tromboembolier, bl&#248;dninger og leukemisk transformation. En raekke mutationer som driver MPN sygdommene er identificeret, bl.a. JAK2V617F-mutationen som medf&#248;rer en deregulering JAK/STAT signalvejen, der bl.a. har betydning for cellers vaekst og overlevelse. Et tidligere stort registerstudie har vist at patienter med MPNs har en &#248;get risiko for neovaskulaer AMD og et pilotstudie har vist &#248;get forekomst af intermediaer AMD. Dette &#248;nsker vi at unders&#248;ge naermere i et st&#248;rre studie i dette Ph.d.- projekt. Flere studier har ogs&#229; vist at kronisk inflammation spiller en vigtig rolle for b&#229;de initiering og udvikling af den maligne celleklon hos MPNs og herfra er en \"Human Inflammationsmodel\" blevet udviklet. Siden er MPN sygdommene blevet anvendt som \"model sygdomme\" for en tilsvarende inflammationsmodel for udvikling af Alzheimers sygdom. I dette Ph.d.-projekt vil vi tilsvarende fors&#248;ge at unders&#248;ge systemisk inflammation i forhold til forekomst af druser. Det vil vi g&#248;re ved at sammenligne systemiske immunologiske mark&#248;rer som tidligere er unders&#248;gt hos patienter med AMD og sammenligne med MPN. Specielt er vi interesseret i systemiske immunologiske forskelle p&#229; patienter med MPN og druser (MPNd) og MPN med normale nethinder (MPNn). Denne afhandling best&#229;r af to overordnede studier. I Studie I, unders&#248;gte vi forekomsten af retinale forandringer associeret med AMD hos 200 patienter med MPN (artikel I). Studie II, omhandlede immunologiske ligheder ved AMD og MPN, og var opdelt i yderligere tre delstudier hvor vi unders&#248;gte hhv. systemiske mark&#248;rer for inflammation, aldring og angiogenese (artikel II, III og IV). Vi unders&#248;gte mark&#248;rerne i fire typer af patienter: nAMD, intermediaer AMD (iAMD), MPNd og MPNn. Unders&#248;gelsen af forskelle mellem MPNd og MPNn, vil g&#248;re det muligt at identificere forandringer i immunsystemet som kunne vaere relevante for AMD-patogenesen. Vi vil endvidere sammenholde resultaterne for patienter med MPN med patienter som har iAMD og nAMD. I studie I (Artikel I) fandt vi at patienter med MPN har en signifikant h&#248;jere praevalens af store druser og AMD tidligere i livet sammenlignet med estimater fra tre store befolkningsunders&#248;gelser. Vi fandt ogs&#229; at forekomst af druser var associeret med h&#248;jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, hvilket indikerer et h&#248;jere niveau af kronisk inflammation i patienterne med druser sammenlignet med dem uden druser. I studie II (Artikel II, III og IV) fandt vi flere immunologiske forskelle mellem patienter med MPNd og MPNn. Da vi unders&#248;gte mark&#248;rer for inflammation, fandt vi en h&#248;jere grad af systemisk inflammation i MPNd end MPNn. Dette blev vist ved en h&#248;jere inflammationsscore (udregnet p&#229; baggrund af niveauer af pro-inflammatoriske mark&#248;rer), en h&#248;jere neutrofil-lymfocyt ratio, samt indikationer p&#229; et dereguleret komplementsystem. Ved unders&#248;gelse af aldringsmark&#248;rer fandt vi tegn p&#229; accelereret immunaldring hos MPNd i forhold til MPNn, hvilket kommer til udtryk ved en st&#248;rre procentdel af \"effector memory T celler\". Endelig fandt vi en vaesentlig lavere ekspression af CXCR3 p&#229; T celler og monocytter hos patienter med nAMD sammenlignet med iAMD, MPNd og MPNn. Dette er i overensstemmelse med tidligere studier hvor CXCR3 ekspression er fundet lavere end hos raske kontroller. Derudover fandt vi en faldende CXCR3 ekspression p&#229; monocytter over det biologiske MPN-kontinuum. Disse studier indikerer en involvering af CXCR3 i b&#229;de nAMD og PMF, begge sygdomsstadier som er karakteriseret ved angiogenese og fibrose. Ud fra resultaterne af denne afhandling kan vi konkludere at forekomsten af druser og AMD hos MPN er &#248;get i forhold til baggrundsbefolkningen. Endvidere viser vores resultater at systemisk inflammation muligvis spiller en vaesentlig st&#248;rre rolle i udviklingen af AMD end tidligere antaget. Vi foresl&#229;r derfor en AMD-model (Figur 18) hvor inflammation kan initiere og accelerere den normale aldersafhaengige akkumulation af affaldsstoffer i nethinden, som senere udvikler sig til druser, medf&#248;rende &#248;get lokal inflammation og med tiden tidlig og intermediaer AMD. Dette resulterer i den &#248;gede risiko for udvikling til de invaliderende senstadier af AMD. ENGLISH SUMMARY: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in high-income countries. It is a progressive retinal disease leading to damage of the cells responsible for central vision. The early stages of the disease are often asymptomatic, while late-stage AMD, which is divided into two entities, neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), both show vision loss, though generally with different progression rates. Drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in the retina characterise early AMD, while nAMD and GA show angiogenesis in and atrophy of the retina, respectively. The aetiology is multifactorial and, in addition to ageing, which is the most significant risk factor for developing AMD, environmental- and genetic risk factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. Research has focused on local changes in the eye where inflammation has been found to play an essential role, but studies also point to systemic alterations and especially systemic inflammation to be involved in the pathogenesis. The Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a group of haematological cancers with an acquired genetic defect of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell, characterised by excess haematopoiesis of the myeloid cell lineage. The diseases have been found to evolve in a biological continuum from early cancer state, essential thrombocythemia, over polycythaemia vera (PV), to the advanced myelofibrosis stage (PMF). The symptoms in these patients are often a result of the changes in the blood composition, hyperviscosity, microvascular disturbances, and reduced tissue perfusion. The major causes of morbidity and mortality are thromboembolic- and haemorrhagic events, and leukemic transformation. A group of mutations that drive the MPNs has been identified, e.g., the JAK2V617F mutation, which results in deregulation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway important, for instance, in cell differentiation and survival. A previous large register study has shown that patients with MPNs have an increased risk of neovascular AMD, and a pilot study has shown an increased prevalence of intermediate AMD. We wish to study this further in a larger scale study. Several studies have also shown that systemic inflammation plays an essential role in both the initiation and progression of the malignant cell clone in MPNs. From this knowledge, a \"Human inflammation model\" has been developed. Since then, the MPNs has been used as model diseases for a similar inflammation model for the development of Alzheimer\\'s disease. In this PhD project, we would like to investigate systemic inflammation in relation to drusen presence. We will do this by comparing systemic immunological markers previously investigated in patients with AMD and compare with MPN. We are primarily interested in systemic immunological differences between patients with MPN and drusen (MPNd) and MPN with normal retinas (MPNn). This thesis consists of two main studies. Study I investigated the prevalence of retinal changes associated with AMD and the prevalence of different AMD stages in 200 patients with MPN (paper I). Study II examined immunological similarities between AMD and MPNs. This study was divided into three substudies exploring systemic markers of inflammation, ageing and angiogenesis, respectively. This was done in four types of patients: nAMD, intermediate AMD (iAMD), MPNd and MPNn. Investigating, differences between MPNd and MPNn, will make it possible to identify changes in the immune system, relevant for AMD pathogenesis. Additionally, we will compare patients with MPNs with patients with iAMD and nAMD. In study I (Paper I), we found that patients with MPNs have a significantly higher prevalence of large drusen and consequently AMD from an earlier age compared to the estimates from three large population-based studies. We also found that drusen prevalence was associated with a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicating a higher level of chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with drusen compared to those without drusen. In study II (papers II, III and IV), we found immunological differences between patients with MPNd and MPNn. When we investigated markers of inflammation, we found a higher level of systemic inflammation in MPNd than MPNn. This was indicated by a higher inflammation score (based on levels of pro-inflammatory markers), a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and indications of a deregulated complement system. When examining markers of ageing, we found signs of accelerated immune ageing in MPNd compared to MPNn, shown by more senescent effector memory T cells. Finally, when exploring a marker of angiogenesis, we found a lower CXCR3 expression on monocytes and T cells in nAMD compared to iAMD, MPNd and MPNn, in line with previous studies of nAMD compared to healthy controls. Further, we found decreasing CXCR3 expression over the MPN biological continuum. These studies indicate CXCR3 involvement in both nAMD and PMF, two disease stages characterised by angiogenesis and fibrosis. From the results of this PhD project, we can conclude that the prevalence of drusen and AMD is increased in patients with MPN compared to the general population. Further, our results show that systemic inflammation may play a far more essential role in AMD pathogenesis than previously anticipated. We, therefore, propose an AMD model (Figure&#160;18) where inflammation can initiate and accelerate the normal age-dependent accumulation of debris in the retina, which later evolve into drusen, resulting in increased local inflammation, and over time early- and intermediate AMD. This results in the increased risk of developing the late debilitating stages of AMD.',\n",

Methods We obtained the constituents of the rosemary volatile oil by searching Chinese herbal systemic pharmacological databases and analytical platforms, and we constructed the constituent-target networks by predicting and screening the action targets of the rosemary volatile oil constituents using SwissTargetPrediction, metaTarFisher, and Pubchem. We obtained the AD-related targets using the Genecards, OMIM, and DisGeNET databases, and we constructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) using the STRING database in Venny 2.1.0 graph to screen the cross-targets by screening the core-acting targets. Cytoscape 3.8.2 software was used to construct a component-target-pathway network to screen the potential active components of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD and to predict the mechanism of action of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD in combination with existing pharmacological studies. We performed a gene ontology (GO) biological process and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the targets of the rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD using R language and molecular docking using Discovery Studio 4.0 software to validate their biological activities. Results A network constructed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 26 potential active ingredients in the rosemary volatile oil. We retrieved a total of 10762 AD targets from Genecards and other used databases. Our GO enrichment analysis yielded 39 entries (P &lt; 0.05), including 14 entries for biological processes, five entries for cellular composition, and 20 entries for molecular function. A total of 14 entries (P &lt; 0.05) were then enriched in the KEGG pathway that primarily involved the IL-17 signaling pathway and the AGE-RAGE pathway. Conclusion The active components of rosemary volatile oil had good inhibition of the inflammatory response. This study provides a reference and guidance for the in-depth study of rosemary volatile oil for the treatment of AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright&#169; Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

COVID-19 also caused the acceleration of AD symptom onset. In this regard, the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 were reported to be increased in patients with AD due to multiple pathological changes such as excessive expression of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or drug-drug interactions in patients receiving polypharmacy and the high presence of proinflammatory molecules.

Other drugs, such as memantine and donepezil, are available, but they cannot prevent the onset of AD in middle age. Based on available clinical data, the valuable effects of statins are mediated by alteration of &#946;-amyloid (A&#946;) and tau metabolism, genetic and lifestyle risk factors along with other clinical aspects of AD. These findings suggested the use of statins in middle age may help to prevent Alzheimer's disease by modifying genetic and non-genetic risk factors in later stage of life. In the present review, we elaborated upon the modification of risk factors and amyloid metabolism in the development and progression of AD and their modulation through atorvastatin.

An accumulating body of research indicates that microglia may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We hypothesised that sex differences in the transcriptome of human myeloid cells may contribute to the sex difference observed in AD prevalence. To explore this, we assessed bulk and single-nuclear RNA sequencing data sets generated from four human derived myeloid cell populations: post-mortem microglial nuclei, peripheral monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglial-like cells (MGLs). We found that expression of AD risk genes, gene signatures associated with the inflammatory response in AD, and genes related to proinflammatory immune responses were enriched in microglial nuclei isolated from aged female donors without ante-mortem neurological disease, relative to those from males. In addition, these inflammation-associated gene sets were found to be enriched in peripheral monocytes isolated from postmenopausal women and in MDMs obtained from premenopausal individuals relative to age-matched males. Expression of these gene sets did not differ in MDMs derived from women whose blood was sampled across the menstrual cycle or in MGLs cultured with 17&#946;-oestradiol. This suggests that the observed gene set enrichments in myeloid cells from women were not being driven by acute hormonal influences. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the increased prevalence of AD in women may be partly explained by a myeloid cell phenotype biased towards expression of biological processes relevant to AD.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Removal of ubiquitin provides access for enzymatic tau acetylation at lysines 281 and 274. USP11 escapes complete X-inactivation, and female mice and people both exhibit higher USP11 levels than males. Genetic elimination of usp11 in a tauopathy mouse model preferentially protects females from acetylated tau accumulation, tau pathology, and cognitive impairment.

Notwithstanding the complexity by which cholesterol biology is governed in the mammalian brain, excess neuronal cholesterol is primarily eliminated by metabolic clearance via cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1). No methods are currently available for visualizing cholesterol metabolism in the living human brain; therefore, a noninvasive technology that quantitatively measures the extent of brain cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 could broadly affect disease diagnosis and treatment options using targeted therapies. Here, we describe the development and testing of a CYP46A1-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, <sup>18</sup>F-CHL-2205 (<sup>18</sup>F-Cholestify). Our data show that PET imaging readouts correlate with CYP46A1 protein expression and with the extent to which cholesterol is metabolized in the brain, as assessed by cross-species postmortem analyses of specimens from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Proof of concept of in vivo efficacy is provided in the well-established 3xTg-AD murine model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where we show that the probe is sensitive to differences in brain cholesterol metabolism between 3xTg-AD mice and control animals. Furthermore, our clinical observations point toward a considerably higher baseline brain cholesterol clearance via CYP46A1 in women, as compared to age-matched men.

In 2022, the estimated healthcare costs associated with AD treatment were $321 billion, with costs projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. These cost-of-care projections are based on direct healthcare costs and are likely underestimated because indirect costs associated with AD treatment are usually not included. Indirect costs such as loss in productivity, diminished quality of life, and an increasing dependence on informal unpaid care provided by family caregivers augments the economic and societal burden of this disease.

Percentile regression estimates per diagnosis populate interactive graphs, alongside NfL background information (available on: https://mybiomarkers.shinyapps.io/Neurofilament). This accessible interface provides reference for interpretation of the individual patient results for clinicians. It showcases an adaptable method to support interpretation of age-dependent biomarkers in neurology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Mid-life hypertension is an important predictor of later-life cognitive impairment and brain neurodegenerative conditions. These findings highlight the pivotal role of preventing and managing hypertension as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric and sleep disturbances can arise in neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in blood pressure variability (BPV). The BPV itself can worsen the progression of the disease.

A growing body of evidence has shown that e-cigarettes are associated with acute lung injury and adverse effects in multiple other organs. Previous studies showed that high emissions of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) in aerosols were associated with increased usage of the same e-cigarette coils. However, the impact on lung function of using aged coils has not been reported. We investigated the relationship between coil age and acute lung injury in mice exposed to experimental vaping for 1&#160;h (2 puffs/min, 100&#160;ml/puff). The e-liquid contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin (50:50, vol) only. The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the vaping aerosols increased with age of the nichrome coils starting at 1200 puffs. Mice exposed to e-cigarette aerosols produced from 1800, but not 0 or 900, puff-aged coils caused acute lung injury, increased lung wet/dry weight ratio, and induced lung inflammation (IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946;, MIP-2). Exposure to vaping aerosols from 1800 puff-aged coils decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation in mice compared to mice exposed to air or aerosols from new coils. In conclusion, we observed that the concentration of aldehydes (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) increased with repeated and prolonged usage of e-cigarette coils. Exposure to high levels of aldehyde in vaping aerosol was associated with acute lung injury in mice. These findings show significant risk of lung injury associated with prolonged use of e-cigarette devices.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The main reason is hormonal senescence after menopause, a period characterized by a decline in estrogen levels. Since the effectiveness of drugs currently approved for the treatment of AD is limited, it is necessary to seek the development of new therapeutic strategies. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in AD patients and individuals with dementia in general. The supplementation of this vitamin in dementia patients might be an interesting approach for increasing the effectiveness of pre-existing medications for dementia treatment. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D treatment associated with memantine and donepezil in female mice submitted to ovariectomy (OVX) for five months and subjected to a dementia animal model induced by intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated amyloid &#946;eta (A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub>). For this purpose, Balb/c mice were divided into five experimental groups, which received 17&#8239;days of combined therapy with vitamin D, donepezil, and memantine. Then, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. OVX groups exhibited reduced levels of E2 in serum, which was not altered by the combined therapy. Higher levels of vitamin D3 were found in the OVX animals submitted to the triple-association treatment. Mice exposed to both OVX and the dementia animal model presented impairment in short and long-term spatial and habituation memories. Also, female mice exposed to A&#946; and OVX exhibited a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) levels, and an increase in tumor necrose factor-&#945; (TNF&#945;) levels in the hippocampus. Besides, increased levels of IL-1&#946; in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were observed, as well as a significant increase in immunoreactivity for GFAP, an astrocytes marker, in the hippocampus. Notably, triple-association treatment reversed the effects of the exposition of mice to A&#946; and OVX in the long-term spatial and habituation memories impairment, as well as reversed changes in TNF&#945;, IL-1&#946;, IL-4, and GFAP immunoreactivity levels in the hippocampus of treated animals. Our results indicate that the therapeutic association of vitamin D, memantine, and donepezil has beneficial effects on memory performance and attenuated the neuroinflammatory response in female mice subjected to OVX associated with a dementia animal model.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Overexpressions of A&#946; could induce oxidative stress that might be a key insult to initiate the cascades of A&#946; accumulation. As a result, anti-oxidative stress and attenuating A&#946; accumulation might be one promising intervention for AD treatment. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major component of lipophilic tanshinones in Danshen, is proven to be effective in several diseases, including AD. Due to the poor solubility in water, the clinical application of Tan IIA was limited. Therefore, a great number of nanoparticles were designed to overcome this issue. In the current study, we choose chitson as delivery carrier to load Tanshinone IIA (CS@Tan IIA) and explore the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA on the CL2006 strain, a transgenic C. elegans of AD model organism. Compared with Tan IIA monomer, CS@Tan IIA could significantly prolong the lifespan and attenuate the AD-like symptoms, including reducing paralysis and the A&#946; deposition by inhibiting the oxidative stress. The mechanism study showed that the protection of CS@Tan IIA was attenuated by knockdown of daf-16 gene, but not skn-1. The results indicated that DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway was required in the protective effects of CS@Tan IIA. Besides DAF-16/SOD-3 pathway, the Tan IIA-loaded CS nanoparticles might protect the C. elegans against the AD insults via promoting autophagy. All the results consistently suggested that coating by chitosan could improve the solubility of Tan IIA and effectively enhance the protective effects of Tan IIA on AD, which might provide a potential drug loading approach for the hydrophobic drugs as Tan IIA.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Similarly, KP-1 administration protected mice from A&#946;O-induced memory impairment scored by Y-maze and novel object recognition test (NORT).

Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes. The metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons, astrocytes and microglia were also detailed discussed. Finally, we classified analyzed the role of metabolic disorder of astrocytes in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Thus, a newly formulated drug (zinc <i>ortho</i>-methyl carbonodithioate (ZOMEC)) was investigated for five weeks on seven-week-old BALB/c male mice. ZOMEC 30&#8201;mg/kg was postadministered intraperitoneally during the third week of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) injection. The brain homogenates of the mice were evaluated for their antioxidant potential for ZOMEC. The results including catalase (CAT), glutathione S transferase (GST), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) demonstrated that ZOMEC significantly reverted the oxidative stress stimulated by PTZ in the mouse brain. ZOMEC upregulated p-Akt/Nrf-2 pathways (also supported by molecular docking methods) to revoke PTZ-induced apoptotic protein markers. ZOMEC reversed PTZ-induced neuronal synapse deficits, improved oxidative stress-aided memory impairment, and inhibited the amyloidogenic pathway in mouse brains. The results suggested the potential of ZOMEC as a new, safe, and neurotherapeutic agent to cure neurodegenerative disorders by decreasing AD-like neuropathology in the animal PTZ model.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Rifat Jahan et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Saffron is a traditional medicinal plant used as a food additive. The stigma of saffron has bioactive compounds such as safranal, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, kaempferol, and flavonoid. These bioactive compounds can be extracted using conventional (maceration, solvent extraction, soxhlet extraction, and vapor or hydrodistillation) and novel techniques (emulsion liquid membrane extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-associated extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and supercritical fluid extraction). Saffron is used as a functional ingredient, natural colorant, shelf-life enhancer, and fortifying agent in developing different food products. The demand for saffron has been increasing in the pharma industry due to its protection against cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidepressant properties.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of AD (N<sub>cases</sub>: 21982; N<sub>controls</sub>: 41944), blood CD33 mRNA level, the plasma CD33 protein level, and CD33 expression on immune-cell subtypes were obtained from GWASs conducted in the European population.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>The classic pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (AD neuropathologic changes, or ADNC). However, brains from individuals clinically diagnosed with \"AD-type\" (amnestic) dementia usually harbor heterogeneous neuropathologies in addition to, or other than, ADNC. We hypothesized that some AD-type dementia associated genetic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified from large genomewide association studies (GWAS) were associated with non-ADNC neuropathologies. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from multiple studies with available genotype and neuropathologic phenotype information. Clinical AD/dementia risk alleles of interest were derived from the very large GWAS by Bellenguez et al. (2022) who reported 83 clinical AD/dementia-linked SNVs in addition to the APOE risk alleles. To query the pathologic phenotypes associated with variation of those SNVs, National Alzheimer\\'s disease Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathologic data were linked to AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and AD Genomics Consortium (ADGC) data. Separate data were obtained from the harmonized Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). A total of 4811 European participants had at least ADNC neuropathology data and also genotype data available; data were meta-analyzed across cohorts. As expected, a subset of dementia-associated SNVs were associated with ADNC risk in Europeans-e.g., BIN1, PICALM, CR1, MME, and COX7C. Other gene variants linked to (clinical) AD dementia were associated with non-ADNC pathologies. For example, the associations of GRN and TMEM106B SNVs with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were replicated. In addition, SNVs in TNIP1 and WNT3 previously reported as AD-related were instead associated with hippocampal sclerosis pathology. Some genotype/neuropathology association trends were not statistically significant at P&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05 after correcting for multiple testing, but were intriguing. For example, variants in SORL1 and TPCN1 showed trends for association with LATE-NC whereas Lewy body pathology trended toward association with USP6NL and BIN1 gene variants. A smaller cohort of non-European subjects (n&#160;=&#160;273, approximately one-half of whom were African-Americans) provided the basis for additional exploratory analyses. Overall, these findings were consistent with the hypothesis that some genetic variants linked to AD dementia risk exert their affect by influencing non-ADNC neuropathologies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

Phytoconstituents are gaining popularity due to their neuroprotective properties and ability to target many pathogenic pathways involved with AD. However, because to their lower BBB permeability, poor solubility, and low bioavailability, they have failed to reduce disease progression and treat Alzheimer's disease. Nanotechnology is an emerging tool for overcoming these obstacles in brain drug delivery. Thus, the development of phytochemical-loaded nanocarrier systems can reduce these barriers while improving neuroprotective benefits.

Conversely, PQR530 which exhibits better brain exposure and superior pharmacokinetic properties, reduced tau pathology even when the treatment started after the onset of pathology. Our results show that dosing animals twice per week with PQR530 resulted in intermittent, rather than sustained target engagement. Nevertheless, this pulse-like mTOR inhibition followed by longer intervals of re-activation was sufficient to reduce tau pathology in the cerebral cortex in P301S tau transgenic mice. This suggests that balanced therapeutic dosing of blood-brain-barrier permeable mTOR-inhibitors can result in a disease-modifying effect in AD and at the same time prevents toxic side effects due to prolonged over activation of autophagy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

We studied one such model, designated <i>APP/PS1</i>, and found that mutation of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Mer or its ligand Gas6 greatly exacerbated early death. Lethality was tied to violent seizures that appeared to initiate in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, where Mer plays an essential role in the microglial phagocytosis of both apoptotic and newborn cells normally generated during adult neurogenesis. We found that newborn DG neurons and excitatory synapses between the DG and the cornu ammonis field 3 (CA3) field of the hippocampus were increased in TAM-deficient mice, and that premature death and adult neurogenesis in these mice were coincident. In contrast, the incidence of lethal seizures and the deposition of dense-core amyloid plaques were strongly anticorrelated.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of dementia. Although the amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is deemed a crucial driver of AD, there are no effective therapeutics available to treat A&#946;-caused neurotoxicity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound small particles mediating intercellular traffic of nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Exosomes are a subtype of EVs with a size range of 30-150&#160;nm in diameter. Stem cell-derived EVs are a potential therapeutic for AD, while EVs isolated from normal stem cell cultures generally have a low yield. Here, we studied the EVs secreted by the rat neural stem cells in the presence of heat shock (HS) stimulus. Nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed that HS-derived EVs exhibit significantly higher concentration and larger diameter in comparison to the non-heat shock (NHS)-derived EVs. Mass spectrometric studies of EV proteins revealed that HS-derived EVs contained fewer diverse proteins than NHS-derived exosomes. GO enrichment analysis of the proteins suggested that the top two biological functions of the proteins in HS-derived EVs are involved in the negative regulation of apoptotic process and positive modulation of DNA repair. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of the NHS- and HS-derived EVs were tested in a cell culture model of AD: HS-derived EVs exhibited greater neuroprotection against not only oxidative stress but also amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) induced neurotoxicity compared to NHS-derived EVs. Moreover, HS-derived EVs were also able to dramatically attenuate A&#946;-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress. These data indicate that in response to HS, neural stem cells increase EV production and alter EV morphology and cargo to confer better neuroprotection against oxidative stress and A&#946;-caused neurotoxicity, suggesting that HS-induced EVs from neural stem cells can be a therapeutic agent for AD and possibly other neurological disorders.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The burgeoning near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging fulfills the requirements for a precise diagnosis with good sensitivity and a high signal-to-background ratio and offers opportunities for the efficient AD diagnosis. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complex, there is an ongoing exploration of advanced probes to specifically target AD biomarkers (<i>e.g.</i>, amyloid-<i>&#946;</i> (A<i>&#946;</i>) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, viscosity, peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>), reactive oxygen species, and methylglyoxal). To this end, a great number of small molecular fluorescent probes with good water solubility, blood-brain barrier crossing capability, and ease in tuning photophysical and biological properties have been studied for the AD diagnosis. Herein, we systematically update the progress of NIRF AD probes in the last three years. The special focus is on the mechanisms for the targeted diagnosis and the relationship between the structure and properties of the probes. Importantly, NIRF probes with complementary functions such as dual-responsiveness and multimodal imaging and even therapeutics are discussed. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD probes are briefly elucidated. We hope that this review provides guidance for researchers and expedites the preclinical and clinical study of the NIRF AD probes.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Alzheimer's disease is an intractable disease, and the accumulation of amyloid &#946; in the brain is thought to be involved in the onset of the disease. Additionally, abnormal protein accumulation due to autophagic deficiency may also be involved in disease progression. Autophagy involves a mechanism called selective autophagy. However, the relationship between selective autophagy and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the interaction between p62, an adapter protein, and an APP-related molecule, and found that p62 interacted with the C-terminal fragment of APP (C60). When C60 and p62 are overexpressed, aggregates are formed, and C60 is degraded by autophagy. These aggregates cannot be easily degraded, even with a reducing agent. We also found that autophagosome- and lysosome-marker-positive vesicles were formed in the C60- and p62-expressing cells. Super resolution technology also revealed that p62-C60-positive autophagosomes were formed in the cells. Overall, these results suggest that p62 may bind with C60 to form aggregates and induce autophagy in autophagosomes. These results reveal one of the mechanisms underlying the progression of Alzheimer's disease, in which selective autophagy may be involved.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The purpose of this Mini-Forum is to provide a solutions-based discussion of the ethical and legal gaps and practical questions about how to use and communicate these data. Investigators often use DRE in research. When participants ask for their personal results, investigators have concerns. Will data that was intended to study groups be valid for individuals? Will sharing data cause distress? Debates around sharing DRE became heated when blood-based amyloid tests and amyloid reducing drugs appeared poised to enable clinicians easily to identify people with elevated brain amyloid and reduce it with a drug. Such an approach would transform the traditional role of DRE from investigational to foundational; however, then the high costs, uncertain clinical benefits and risks of the therapy led to an urgent need for education to support clinical decision making. Further complicating DRE use are direct to consumer genetic testing and increasingly available biomarker testing. Withholding DRE becomes less feasible and public education around responsible use and understanding become vital. A critical answer to these legal and ethical issues is supporting education that clearly delineates known risks, benefits, and gaps in knowledge, and communication to promote understanding among researchers, clinicians, patients, and all stakeholders. This paper provides an overview and identifies general concepts and resource documents that support more informed discussions for individuals and interdisciplinary groups.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

In animal models of the disease, hypertension has been shown to exacerbate Alzheimer-like pathology and behavior, while in humans, hypertension during mid-life increases the risk of developing the disease later in life. Unfortunately, once individuals are diagnosed with the disease, there are few therapeutic options available. There is neither an effective symptomatic treatment, one that treats the debilitating cognitive and memory deficits, nor, more importantly, a neuroprotective treatment, one that stops the relentless progression of the pathology. Further, there is no specific preventative treatment that offsets the onset of the disease. A key factor or clue in this quest for an effective preventative and therapeutic treatment may lie in the contribution of hypertension to the disease. In this review, we explore the idea that photobiomodulation, the application of specific wavelengths of light onto body tissues, can reduce the neuropathology and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease by controlling hypertension. We suggest that treatment with photobiomodulation can be an effective preventative and therapeutic option for this neurodegenerative disease.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The statistical data suggested that it is the 3rd major cause of death in older persons. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors play a vital role in the treatment of AD. Coumarins, natural derivatives, are reported as cholinesterase inhibitors and emerges as a promising scaffold for design of ligands targeting enzymes and pathological alterations related to AD. In this regard, the 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were developed for coumarin scaffold containing BChE and AChE inhibitors. Several 3D QSAR pharmacophore models were developed with FAST, BEST, and CEASER methods, and finally, statistically robust models (based on correlation coefficient, cost value, and RMSE value) were selected for further analysis for both targets. The important features ((HBA 1, HBA 2, HY, RA (BChE) HBA 1, HBA 2, HY, PI, (AChE)) were identified for good inhibitory activity of coumarin derivatives. Finally, the selected models were applied to various database compounds to find potential BChE and AChE inhibitors, and we found 13 for BChE and 1 potent compound for AChE with an estimated activity of IC<sub>50</sub>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;10&#160;&#181;M.

Two authors independently searched the electronic databases CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Nine (<i>n</i> = 9) articles were eligible for a review. Our review found a significant association between the activity levels (frequency and entropy) measured by accelerometers and the benchmark instrument of agitated behaviour. However, the performance of wrist accelerometry in identifying the occurrence of agitation episodes was unsatisfactory. Elderly people with dementia have also been monitored in existing studies by investigating the at-risk time for their agitation episodes (daytime and evening). Consideration may be given in future studies on wrist accelerometry to unifying the parameters of interest and the cut-off and measurement periods, and to using a sampling window to standardise the protocol for assessing agitated behaviour through wrist accelerometry.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Cheung, So, Ho, Wong, Lam and Cheung.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

At least twice as many have been infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"Methods\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) and related dementias.

No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a \"green paper\" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and biological characterization that can be further explored. By generating high-quality harmonized data across sites we aim to capture both descriptive and, where possible, causal associations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Compared to those without dementia at HUNT4, those with dementia at HUNT4 had higher SBP at HUNT1 and HUNT2, but lower SBP at HUNT4. These differences at HUNT1 and 2 were especially pronounced among women. Results did not differ across birth cohorts. For dementia subtypes at HUNT4, the VaD group had a higher SBP than the AD group at HUNT2 and 3. Age trajectories in SBP showed that the dementia group experienced a steady increase in SBP until 65 years of age and a decrease from 70 to 90 years. SBP in the no- dementia group increased until 80 years before it leveled off from 80 to 90 years. The present study confirms findings of higher midlife SBP and lower late-life SBP in people with dementia. This pattern may have several explanations and it highlights the need for close monitoring of BP treatment in older adults, with frequent reappraisal of treatment needs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Selbaek, Stuebs, Engedal, Hachinski, Hestad, Trevino, Skjellegrind, Wedatilake and Strand.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

This approval has raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups vs. placebo&#160;=&#160;-0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust. However, this effect remains below the previously established minimal clinically relevant values. In parallel, the drugs significantly increased the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E: risk ratio=13.39; P&lt;0.0001), ARIA-hemorrhage (risk ratio=2.78; P=0.0002), and symptomatic and serious ARIA (7/1321=0.53% in the high dose groups versus 0/1446 in the placebo groups; risk ratio=6.44; P=0.04). The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is so far questionable after 18 months. Identifying subgroups of better responders, the perspective of combination therapies, and a longer follow-up may help improve their clinical relevance. Finally, the preliminary evidence from medico-economical analyses seems to indicate that the current cost of aducanumab in the US is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical benefits.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Author(s).

The toxicity of ADAs as pharmacodynamic components of Aconitum medicinal materials is much lower than that of other diterpenoid alkaloids due to the absence of ester bonds. On the one hand, the pharmacokinetics of ADAs have received little attention compared to other toxic alkaloids. The research primarily focuses on aconine and mesaconine. According to existing studies, ADAs absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily passive with a short T<sub>max</sub>. Simultaneously, efflux transporters have less impact on ADAs absorption than non-ADAs. After entering the body, ADAs are widely distributed in the heart, liver, lungs, and kidney, but less in the brain. Notably, aconine is not well metabolized by liver microsomes. Aconine and mesaconine are excreted in urine and feces, respectively. ADAs, on the other hand, have been shown to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including cardiac, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and regenerative effects via regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Nrf2/ARE, PERK/eIF2&#945;/ATF4/Chop, ERK/CREB, NF-&#954;B, Bcl-2/Bax, and GSK3&#946;/&#946;-catenin signaling pathways.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">ADAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on heart disease, neurological disease, and other systemic diseases.

Treatment with hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and H<sub>2</sub>S donors such as sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) can reduce oxidative stress in preclinical studies, however clinical benefits of such treatments are rather ambiguous. This is partly due to poor stability and bioavailability of the H<sub>2</sub>S donors, requiring impractically large doses that are associated with dose-limiting toxicity. Herein, we identified a bioavailable 3-mercaptopyruvate prodrug, sulfanegen, which is able to pose as a sacrificial redox substrate for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST), one of the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthetic enzymes in the brain. Sulfanegen is able to mitigate toxicity emanating from oxidative insults and the A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> peptide by releasing H<sub>2</sub>S through the 3MST pathway. When administered to symptomatic transgenic mouse model of AD (APP/PS1; 7 and 12 months) and mice that were intracerebroventricularly administered with the A&#946;<sub>1-42</sub> peptide, sulfanegen was able to reverse oxidative and neuroinflammatory consequences of AD pathology by restoring 3MST function. Quantitative neuropathological analyses confirmed significant disease modifying effect of the compound on amyloid plaque burden and brain inflammatory markers. More importantly, sulfanegen treatment attenuated progressive neurodegeneration in these mice, as evident from the restoration of TH+&#160;neurons in the locus coeruleus. This study demonstrates a previously unknown concept that supplementation of 3MST function in the brain may be a viable approach for the management of AD. Finally, brought into the spotlight is the potential of sulfanegen as a promising AD therapeutic for future drug development efforts.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Senile depression (SD) is a heterogeneous syndrome. Several clinical profiles are more likely to appear in SD than in early-life depression, but it remains unclear whether the pathophysiology is different. The prevalence of dementia increases with aging, and the underlying pathophysiological processes in the preclinical phase begin even before cognitive deficits or neurological signs appear. SD may be either a risk factor for developing dementia or a prodromal stage of dementia. The inconsistent findings regarding the association between SD and incident dementia may be attributable to the neuropathological heterogeneity underlying SD. Most studies have focused on patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) as an outcome, but several clinicopathological studies suggest that primary age-related tauopathy and argyrophilic grain disease may account for a proportion of cases clinically misdiagnosed as AD in the elderly population. Furthermore, most AD cases have additional neuropathologic changes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Here, we review the neuropathological findings linking SD to incident dementia, focusing on common age-related neuropathologies. In particular, the roles of disturbance of neural circuity, imbalance of monoaminergic systems, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated neuroinflammatory status are discussed. Finally, we review the current treatment of SD in the context of age-related neuropathological changes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to increased brain microvascular permeability in AD are not fully understood. We studied brain endothelial permeability in female APPswe/PS1&#8710;E9 (APP/PS1) mice which constitute a transgenic mouse model of amyloid-beta (A&#946;) amyloidosis and found that permeability increases with aging in the areas showing the greatest amyloid plaque deposition. We performed an unbiased bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of brain endothelial cells (BECs) in female APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We observed that upregulation of interferon signaling gene expression pathways in BECs was among the most prominent transcriptomic signatures in the brain endothelium. Immunofluorescence analysis of isolated BECs from female APP/PS1 mice demonstrated higher levels of the Type I interferon-stimulated gene IFIT2. Immunoblotting of APP/PS1 BECs showed downregulation of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. Stimulation of human brain endothelial cells with interferon-&#946; decreased the levels of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin as well as tight junction proteins Occludin and Claudin-5 and increased barrier leakiness. Depletion of the Type I interferon receptor in human brain endothelial cells prevented interferon-&#946;-induced VE-cadherin downregulation and restored endothelial barrier integrity.

The strongest association was on 1q32 near Complement receptor type 1 (CR1), where rs6701713 was associated with all ICH (P&#8197;=&#8197;.0074, odds ratio [OR]&#8197;=&#8197;2.07) and lobar ICH (P&#8197;=&#8197;.0073, OR&#8197;=&#8197;2.80). The 51 most significant 2-SNP haplotypes associated with lobar ICH were identified within the Clusterin (CLU) gene. We identified that variation within CR1 and CLU, previously identified risk factors for AD, and are associated with an increased risk for ICH driven primarily by lobar ICH. Previous work implicated CR1 and CLU in cerebral amyloid clearance, the innate immune system, and cellular stress response.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 the Author(s).

Here, we review evidence that has emerged over the past two decades to explain how environmental factors, such as diet, lifestyle, alcohol, smoking and pollutants, might interact with the human genome. In particular, we discuss how various environmental AD risk factors can induce epigenetic modifications of key AD-related genes and pathways and consider how epigenetic mechanisms could contribute to the effects of oxidative stress on AD onset. Studies on early-life exposures are helping to uncover critical time windows of sensitivity to epigenetic influences from environmental factors, thereby laying the foundations for future primary preventative approaches.

While these changes promise to enhance communication and information sharing, they also bring higher risks of unwanted disclosure, both within and outside of health systems. Having preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD), where biological markers of AD are identified before the onset of any symptoms, is sensitive PHI. Because of the melding of ideas between preclinical and \"clinical\" (symptomatic) AD, unwanted disclosure of preclinical AD status can lead to personal harms of stigma, discrimination, and changes to insurability. At present, preclinical AD is identified mainly in research settings, though consensus criteria for a clinical diagnosis may soon be established. There is not yet adequate legal protection for the growing number of individuals with preclinical AD. Some PHI generated in preclinical AD trials has clinical significance, necessitating urgent evaluations and longitudinal monitoring in care settings. AD researchers are obligated to both respect the confidentiality of participants\\' sensitive PHI and facilitate providers\\' access to necessary information, often requiring disclosure of preclinical AD status. The AD research community must continue to develop ethical, participant-centered practices related to confidentiality and disclosure, with attention to sensitive information in the EHR.

Authors argue that these cases may provide a unique body of evidence, so-called 'artistic signatures' of neurodegenerative diseases, that might be used to understand disorders, provide diagnoses, be employed in treatment, create patterns of testable hypotheses for causative study, and also provide unique insight into the neurobiological linkages between the mind, brain, body, and the human penchant for art-making itself. However-before we can begin to meaningfully build from such emerging findings, much less formulate applications-not only is such evidence currently quite disparate and in need of systematic review, almost all case reports and artwork ratings are entirely subjective, based on authors' personal observations or a sparse collection of methods that may not best fit underlying research aims. This leads to the very real question of whether we might actually find patterns of systematic change if fit to a rigorous review-Can we really 'read' art to illuminate possible changes in the brain? How might we best approach this topic in future neuroscientific, clinical, and art-related research? This paper presents a review of this field and answer to these questions. We consider the current case reports for seven main disorders-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia, corticobasal degeneration, aphasia, as well as stroke-consolidating arguments for factors and changes related to art-making and critiquing past methods. Taking the published artworks from these papers, we then conduct our own assessment, employing computerized and human-rater-based approaches, which we argue represent best practice to identify stylistic or creativity/quality changes. We suggest, indeed, some evidence for systematic patterns in art-making for specific disorders and also find that case authors showed rather high agreement with our own assessments. More important, through opening this topic and past evidence to a systematic review, we hope to open a discussion and provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future application and research on the intersection of art-making and the neurotypical, the changed, and the artistic brain.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Author(s).

A&#946;42 can undergo abnormal aggregation and amyloidogenesis in the brain, forming fibrillar plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The insoluble fibrillar forms of A&#946;42 exhibit well-defined, cross &#946;-sheet structures at the molecular level and are less toxic than the soluble, intermediate disordered oligomeric forms. However, the mechanism of initial interaction of monomers and subsequent oligomerization is not well understood. The structural disorder of A&#946;42 adds to the challenges of determining the structural properties of its monomers, making it difficult to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of pathogenic aggregation. Certain regions of A&#946;42 are known to exhibit helical propensity in different physiological conditions. NMR spectroscopy has shown that the A&#946;42 monomer at lower pH can adopt an &#945;-helical conformation and as the pH is increased, the peptide switches to &#946;-sheet conformation and aggregation occurs. CD spectroscopy studies of aggregation have shown the presence of an initial spike in the amount of &#945;-helical content at the start of aggregation. Such an increase in &#945;-helical content suggests a mechanism wherein the peptide can expose critical non-polar residues for interaction, leading to hydrophobic aggregation with other interacting peptides. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize in detail the conformational landscape of monomeric A&#946;42 in solution to identify molecular properties that may mediate the early stages of oligomerization. We hypothesized that conformations with &#945;-helical structure have a higher probability of initiating aggregation because they increase the hydrophobicity of the peptide. Although random coil conformations were found to be the most dominant, as expected, &#945;-helical conformations are thermodynamically accessible, more so than &#946;-sheet conformations. Importantly, for the first time &#945;-helical conformations are observed to increase the exposure of aromatic and hydrophobic residues to the aqueous solvent, favoring their hydrophobically driven interaction with other monomers to initiate aggregation. These findings constitute a first step toward characterizing the mechanism of formation of disordered, low-order oligomers of A&#946;42.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Participants were asked to complete optional daily self-administered assessments remotely on their smart devices over 7 to 8 days. Assessments included immediate and delayed recall of 3 stories from the Automatic Story Recall Task (ASRT), a test with multiple parallel stimuli (18 short stories and 18 long stories) balanced for key linguistic and discourse metrics. Verbal responses were recorded and securely transferred from participants\\' personal devices and automatically transcribed and scored using text similarity metrics between the source text and retelling to derive a generalized match score. Group differences in adherence and task performance were examined using logistic and linear mixed models, respectively. Correlational analysis examined parallel-forms reliability of ASRTs and convergent validity with cognitive tests (Logical Memory Test and Preclinical Alzheimer\\'s Cognitive Composite with semantic processing). Acceptability and usability data were obtained using a remotely administered questionnaire.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Of the 200 participants recruited in the AMYPRED studies, 151 (75.5%)-78 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 73 MCI or mild AD-engaged in optional remote assessments. Adherence to daily assessment was moderate and did not decline over time but was higher in CU participants (ASRTs were completed each day by 73/106, 68.9% participants with MCI or mild AD and 78/94, 83% CU participants). Participants reported favorable task usability: infrequent technical problems, easy use of the app, and a broad interest in the tasks. Task performance improved modestly across the week and was better for immediate recall. The generalized match scores were lower in participants with MCI or mild AD (Cohen d=1.54). Parallel-forms reliability of ASRT stories was moderate to strong for immediate recall (mean rho 0.73, range 0.56-0.88) and delayed recall (mean rho=0.73, range=0.54-0.86). The ASRTs showed moderate convergent validity with established cognitive tests.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The unsupervised, self-administered ASRT task is sensitive to cognitive impairments in MCI and mild AD. The task showed good usability, high parallel-forms reliability, and high convergent validity with established cognitive tests.

In the first case, the toxic effect of mercury and arsenic on the brain stimulates oxidative stress, which leads to the formation of free oxygen species and a decrease in the antioxidant defense of neurons. In the second case, the harmful effect of mercury changes the structure and properties of &#946;-amyloid, and the toxic effect of arsenic contributes to its accumulation. In the pathogenesis of the diseases under consideration, particular importance is attached to the reaction of astrocytes that initiate neuroinflammation, which is also characteristic of mercury and arsenic intoxication. Considering that the symptoms recorded during intoxication with mercury and arsenic are in many respects similar to those of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and their pathogenetic mechanisms (oxidative stress and neuroinflammation) coincide, then the toxic effects of mercury and arsenic in neurodegenerative diseases analyzed in this review can be characterized as the influence of the most significant risk factors.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The main pathological features of AD are &#946;-amyloid protein (A&#946;) deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Currently, there are no effective drugs for the etiological treatment of AD. Rifampicin (RIF) is a semi-synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic with anti-&#946;-amyloid deposition, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, and neuroprotective effects, but its application in AD treatment has been limited for its strong hydrophobicity, high toxicity, short half-life, low bioavailability, and blood-brain barrier hindrance. We designed a novel brain-targeted and MRI-characteristic nanomedicine via loading rabies virus protein 29 (RVG29), rifampicin, and Gd on poly (l-lactide) nanoparticles (RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29). The cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 had favorable biocompatibility and security. Fluorescence imaging in vivo showed that PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 could deliver rifampicin into the brain by enhancing cellular uptake and brain targeting performance, leading to improvement of the bioavailability of rifampicin. In in vivo study, RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 improved the spatial learning and memory capability of APP/PS1 mice in the Morris water maze, as compared to rifampicin. Immunofluorescence, TEM, immunoblotting, and H&amp;E staining revealed that RIF@PLA-PEG-Gd/Mal-RVG29 reduced A&#946; deposition in hippocampal and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, improved the damage of synaptic ultrastructure, increased the expression level of PSD95 and SYP, as well as reduced the necrosis of neurons.

One application is to discover disease subtypes using unsupervised clustering. However, existing clustering methods are often applied to input features directly, and could suffer from the curse of dimensionality with high-dimensional multimodal data. The purpose of our study is to identify multimodal imaging-driven subtypes in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants using a multiview learning framework based on Deep Generalized Canonical&#160;Correlation&#160;Analysis (DGCCA), to learn shared latent representation with low dimensions from 3 neuroimaging modalities.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">DGCCA applies non-linear transformation to input views using neural networks and is able to learn correlated&#160;embeddings with low dimensions that capture more variance than its linear counterpart, generalized CCA (GCCA). We designed experiments to compare DGCCA embeddings with single modality features and GCCA embeddings by generating 2 subtypes from each feature set using unsupervised clustering. In our validation studies, we found that amyloid PET imaging has the most discriminative features compared with structural MRI and FDG PET which DGCCA learns from but not GCCA. DGCCA subtypes show differential measures in 5 cognitive assessments, 6 brain volume measures, and conversion to AD patterns. In addition, DGCCA MCI subtypes confirmed AD genetic markers with strong signals that existing late MCI group did not identify.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Overall, DGCCA is able to learn effective low dimensional embeddings from multimodal data by learning non-linear projections. MCI subtypes generated from DGCCA embeddings are different from existing early and late MCI groups and show most similarity with those identified by amyloid PET features. In our validation studies, DGCCA subtypes show distinct patterns in cognitive measures, brain volumes, and are able to identify AD genetic markers. These findings indicate the promise of the imaging-driven subtypes and their power in revealing disease structures beyond early and late stage MCI.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Mutations in these genes are not limited to AD, as APP mutations can also cause an amyloid form of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, whilst PSEN1 and PSEN2 are involved in NOTCH3 signalling, a process known to be dysregulated in the monogenic CSVD, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The overlap between AD genes and causes of CSVD led to the hypothesis that mutations in other genes within the PANTHER AD-presenilin pathway may be novel causes of CSVD in a cohort of clinically suspicious CADASIL patients without a pathogenic NOTCH3 mutation. To investigate this, whole exome sequencing was performed on 50 suspected CADASIL patients with no NOTCH3 mutations, and a targeted gene analysis was completed on the PANTHER.

The purpose of the present investigation was to develop a visual assessment method that provides both an overall assessment of brain tauopathy and regional characterization of abnormal tau deposition. <b>Methods:</b> 18-F MK-6240 scans from 102 participants (including healthy volunteers, patients with AD or other neurodegenerative disorders) were reviewed by an expert nuclear medicine physician blind to participants' diagnosis to identify common patterns of brain uptake. This initial visual read method was field tested in a separate, non-overlapping cohort of 102 participants with 2 additional na&#239;ve readers trained on the method. Visual read outcomes were compared with semiquantitative assessments using volume of interest (VOI) SUVr. <b>Results:</b> For the visual read eight gray-matter regions per hemisphere were assessed as negative (no abnormal uptake) or positive (1-25% of the region involved, 25-75% involvement, or &gt;75% involvement), then characterized the tau binding pattern as positive or negative for evidence of tau, and if positive, whether brain uptake is in an AD pattern. Readers demonstrated agreement 94% of the time for overall positivity/negativity. Concordance on the determination of the regional binary outcomes (negative or positive) showed agreement of 74.3 % and Fleiss' k of 0.912. Using clinical diagnosis as the ground truth, readers demonstrated a sensitivity of 73-79% and specificity of 91-93, with combined reader concordance sensitivity of 80% and specificity 93%.

Structural polymorphism observed among A&#946; fibrils in AD brains seem to correlate with the clinical subtypes suggesting a link between fibril polymorphism and pathology. Since fibrils emerge from a templated growth of low-molecular-weight oligomers, understanding the factors affecting oligomer generation is important. Membrane lipids are key factors to influence early stages of A&#946; aggregation and oligomer generation, which cause membrane disruption. We have previously demonstrated that conformationally discrete A&#946; oligomers can be generated by modulating the charge, composition, and chain length of lipids and surfactants. Here, we extend our studies into liposomal models by investigating A&#946; oligomerization on large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of total brain extracts (TBE), reconstituted lipid rafts (LRs), or 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Varying the vesicle composition by specifically increasing the amount of GM1 gangliosides as a constituent, we found that only GM1-enriched liposomes induce the formation of toxic, low-molecular-weight oligomers. Furthermore, we found that the aggregation on liposome surface and membrane disruption are highly cooperative and sensitive to membrane surface characteristics. Numerical simulations confirm such a cooperativity and reveal that GM1-enriched liposomes form twice as many pores as those formed in the absence GM1. Overall, this study uncovers mechanisms of cooperativity between oligomerization and membrane disruption under controlled lipid compositional bias, and refocuses the significance of the early stages of A&#946; aggregation in polymorphism, propagation, and toxicity in AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

There are no drugs or other therapeutic agents to prevent or delay AD progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short and uncoded RNAs that can bind to 200 RNAs approximately. By inhibiting or destroying specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), they control gene expression and broadly affect cellular functions. MiRNAs play important roles in regulating neuronal growth, neuronal differentiation, dendritic spine morphology, and synaptic flexibility in the nervous system. The expression levels of miRNAs are changed in neurological diseases, including AD, suggesting that they play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Since the number of patients grows every year and may exceed 115 million by 2050, and due to the lack of effective therapies, early prediction of AD remains a global challenge, solution of which can contribute to the timely appointment of a preventive therapy in order to avoid irreversible changes in the brain. To date, clinical assays for the markers of amyloidosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been developed, which, in conjunction with the brain MRI and PET studies, are used either to confirm the diagnosis based on obligate clinical criteria or to predict the risk of AD developing at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the problem of predicting AD at the asymptomatic stage remains unresolved. In this regard, the search for new protein markers and studies of proteomic changes in CSF and blood plasma are of particular interest and may consequentially identify particular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Studies of specific proteomic changes in blood plasma deserve special attention and are of increasing interest due to the much less invasive method of sample collection as compared to CSF, which is important when choosing the object for large-scale screening. This review briefly summarizes the current knowledge on proteomic markers of AD and considers the prospects of developing reliable methods for early identification of AD risk factors based on the proteomic profile.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Over 18 years follow-up, we extended the family with 10 p.R406W carriers and provided an in-depth clinical description of the patients. Additionally, genetic screening was used to identify p.R406W carriers in Belgian cohorts of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease patients and to calculate p.R406W frequency. In the frontotemporal dementia cohort, we found four p.R406W carriers (n&#8201;=&#8201;647,0.62%) and three in the Alzheimer's disease cohort (n&#8201;=&#8201;1134, 0.26%). Haplotype sharing analysis showed evidence of a shared haplotype suggesting that they are descendants of a common ancestor. Of the p.R406W patients, we describe characteristics of neuropsychological, imaging and fluid biomarkers as well as neuropathologic examination. Intriguingly, the phenotypic spectrum among the p.R406W patients ranged from typical behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia to clinical Alzheimer's disease, based on CSF biomarker analysis and amyloid PET scan. Heterogeneous overlap syndromes existed in between, with highly common neuropsychiatric symptoms like disinhibition and aggressiveness, which occurred in 100% of frontotemporal dementia and 58% of clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. This was also the case for memory problems, 89% in frontotemporal dementia and 100% in clinical Alzheimer's disease patients. Median age at death was significantly lower in patients with frontotemporal dementia (68 years) compared to clinical Alzheimer's disease patients (79 years), though the sizes of the sub-cohorts are limited and do not allow prognostic predictions. Postmortem brain analysis of one p.R406W patient with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia revealed frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathology. Notably, neuropathological investigation showed only 3R tau isoforms in the absence of 4R tau reactivity, an unusual finding in microtubule-associated protein tau-related frontotemporal lobar degeneration. No traces of amyloid pathology were present. Prevalence of the p.R406W mutation was relatively high in both frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease Belgian patient cohorts. These findings grant new insights into genotype-phenotype correlations of p.R406W carriers.

Little is known about the extent to which targetable pathogenic mechanisms are shared among these seemingly diverse diseases. Translational control is critical for maintaining proteostasis during aging. Gaining control of the translation machinery is also crucial in the battle between viruses and their hosts. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that overexpression of SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) robustly rescued neuromuscular degeneration and behavioral phenotypes in <i>Drosophila</i> models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These diseases share a common mechanism: the accumulation of aberrant protein species due to the stalling and collision of translating ribosomes, leading to proteostasis failure. Our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that Nsp1 acted in a multipronged manner to resolve collided ribosomes, abort stalled translation, and remove faulty translation products causative of disease in these models, at least in part through the ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, ribosome-associated quality-control factors, autophagy, and AKT signaling. Nsp1 exhibited exquisite specificity in its action, as it did not modify other neurodegenerative conditions not known to be associated with ribosome stalling. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of Nsp1 in manipulating host translation, which can be leveraged for combating age-related neurodegenerative diseases that are affecting millions of people worldwide and currently without effective treatment.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Traditional drug discovery is based on a binding affinity (thermodynamics)-driven paradigm. Numerous examples, however, demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always depend only on binding affinity but positively correlates with binding kinetics, that is, the dissociation rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>). Binding free energy landscape (BFEL) constructor is a computational binding kinetics prediction method, previously developed by us, that estimates the binding kinetics for ligand-protein based on their constructed binding free energy landscape, but it also reveals the detailed molecular mechanism of the binding event, hence, providing the position of transition states at the molecular level to modify/improve the binding kinetics. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) target for which there is still not an ideal drug on the market. Therefore, to improve the drug design strategy for AD, the binding kinetics and binding molecular mechanisms of the four inhibitors of AChE, that is, E2020 (Aricept), HupA, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine, were studied. Also, the differentiation of the binding kinetics between <i>m</i>AChE and <i>Tc</i>AChE was studied to evaluate the sensitiveness of BFEL constructor. The flexibility of molecules has a noticeable effect on the nature of BFEL. To the same target, flexible molecules (i.e., E2020 and Rivastigmine) which contain more rotatable bonds tend to have more complicated BFELs reflecting more complicated molecular action mechanisms than the rigid ones (i.e., HupA and Galantamine), which therefore could be more challenging to be optimized. The binding kinetics is highly dependent on the structure of the molecules, such as the length and the functional groups. Therefore, E2020 presents better binding kinetic and thermodynamic properties with either <i>Tc</i>AChE or <i>m</i>AChE. Therefore, it is the most promising lead drug for binding kinetics-based drug design. In addition, the binding kinetics of a drug may present different values in the proteins of different organisms because the residue compositions of the binding gorges of the targets are variant, that is, E2020 shows lower binding affinity and association energy barrier in binding with <i>m</i>AChE than <i>Tc</i>AChE. However, HupA presents a better binding property with <i>Tc</i>AChE than <i>m</i>AChE.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

By docking computation for binding with TRKB using 7,8-DHF as a control, all four LMDS compounds displayed potential of binding to domain d5 of TRKB. In addition, all four LMDS compounds exhibited anti-aggregation and neuroprotective efficacy on SH-SY5Y cells with induced A&#946;-GFP expression. Knock-down of TRKB significantly attenuated TRKB downstream signaling and the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of these LMDS compounds.

Visual deficits potentially increase dementia risk in a vulnerable individual by reducing resilience to dementia. Hearing deficits may indicate a susceptibility to Alzheimer disease through a variety of mechanisms.

Currently, available pharmaceutical medicines and products are limited, and they have side effects at a higher price. Researchers and scientists have observed significant effects of nutraceuticals. Various preclinical and clinical studies were investigated for the Anti-Alzheimer's activity of nutraceuticals. The increasing ability of the pathogenesis of AD has led to the analysis of novel therapeutic targets, including the pathophysiological mechanisms and distinct cascades. So, current improvement will show the most adequate and prominent nutraceuticals and suggested concise mechanisms involving autophagy regulation, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, mitochondrial homeostasis, and others. The effects of nutraceuticals cannot be ignored; it is important to investigate high-quality clinical trials. Given the potential of nutraceuticals to battle AD as multi-targeted therapies, it's vital to evaluate them as viable lead compounds for drug discovery and development. To the best of the authors 'knowledge, modification of blood-brain barrier permeability, bioavailability, and aspects of randomized clinical trials should be considered in prospective investigations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Advancements in molecular diagnostic and fundamentals have implemented particular usefulness for drug evaluation. An excess of experimental knowledge occurs regarding the effect of nutraceuticals on AD. There are various preclinical and clinical studies that have been done on nutraceuticals. In addition, various substitute inhibit and enhance some pathophysiological levels associated with AD. Nutraceuticals are easily available and have fewer side effects with cost-effective advantages.

Deposits of beta-amyloid (A&#946;) were also found in the retina of AD patients. At the same time, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) occupies the first place among geronto-ophthalmic pathologies in patients with AD. POAG, like AD, is a neurodegenerative disease. AD and POAG have common symptoms, and therefore several common principles for their early diagnosis can be developed. Therefore, a promising direction is the search for biomarkers for the early detection of AD and POAG. Currently, the diagnosis of early AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and biomarkers in the brain (imaging of amyloid plaques and tau positron emission tomography) are well studied, while data in literature on using these biomarkers in patients with POAG is scarce. However, the above diagnostic methods are not considered in routine clinical practice due to their invasiveness and high cost. There is a growing need for conventional, affordable biomarkers for AD and POAG, as it is necessary to start treatment of prodromal conditions from symptoms to onset of symptoms. In this connection, biomarkers such as A&#946; and tau protein in blood serum and plasma are actively evaluated in patients with AD. In patients with POAG, there is no published data on studies of these biomarkers, which requires scientific research. Many authors discover the role of sirtuins (SIRT) in aging and age-related diseases, such as AD, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and others.

The etiology of sporadic AD that accounts for a vast majority of cases remains poorly understood, with no effective therapeutic interventions. Genetic studies have identified AD risk genes including the most prominent, <i>APOE</i>, of which the &#603;4 allele increases risk in a dose-dependent manner. A breakthrough discovery enabled the creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can be differentiated into various brain cell types, facilitating AD research in genetically human models. Herein, we provide a brief background on AD in the context of <i>APOE</i> susceptibility and feature work employing hiPSC-derived brain cell and tissue models to interrogate the contribution of <i>APOE</i> in driving AD pathology. Such models have delivered crucial insights into cellular mechanisms and cell type-specific roles underlying the perturbed biological functions that trigger pathogenic cascades and propagate neurodegeneration. Collectively, hiPSC-based models are envisioned to be an impactful platform for uncovering fundamental AD understanding, with high translational value toward AD drug discovery and testing.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 Pinals and Tsai.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The results showed that AM reduced the chemotactic index of transgenic C. elegans CL2241, and decreased the content of A&#946; in the supernatant of cell culture medium at different concentrations. In addition, AM lowered the protein level of APP and the fluorescence intensity of APP in a dose-dependent manner. Transcriptional activity of TFEB and fluorescence intensity of mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid were enhanced after AM treatment, and the value of RLuc-LC3 wt/RLuc-LC3 G120 A was reduced. AM promoted the protein levels of TFEB, LAMP2 and Beclin1 at different concentrations, and increased the protein expression ratio of LC3&#8545;/LC3&#8544; in a dose-dependent manner.

The involvement of RAS has been mediated through Angiotensin II (AngII), which is overexpressed in aging brains. However, the exact mechanism of how AngII contributes to AD is unknown. Thus, we hypothesize that AngII increases p-tau by activating its kinases, CDK5 and MAPK.

In brain, AdipoRon induced AMPK activation, increased insulin sensitivity, reduced amyloid beta plaque deposition and improved cognitive impairment. Levels of BACE were also downregulated while LDLR, APOE and neprilysin were upregulated promoting amyloid beta clearance from brain. AdipoRon further reduced the chronic inflammatory marker, GFAP and improved synaptic markers PSD-95 and synaptophysin in APP/PS1 mice. Our in-vitro studies further confirmed the potential role of AdipoRon in improving insulin sensitivity by increasing GLUT 4 translocation, glucose uptake and insulin signaling under hyperinsulinemic condition. Our findings suggest that AdipoRon could be a promising lead in the future treatment strategies in the development of effective AD treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

Many efforts have been made to decrease the effects of the disease but also to block the neurodegenerative process. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are a group of medicines that act at the neurotransmission of acetylcholine, preventing its excessive breakdown and helping to improve cognitive functions in patients with AD. In this work, 16 chiral steroids, namely ring-fused 3&#946;-acetoxyandrost-5-ene derivatives, their precursor and two 16-dehydroprogesterone-derived dioximes, were assessed as cholinesterase inhibitors and neuroprotective agents. The results demonstrated that some of the tested steroids are cholinesterase inhibitors and the majority selective for acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

The changes in amyloid pathology are accompanied by robust microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, which suggest a protective glial response that may limit amyloid plaque development in G protein-biased GPR3 AD mice.

The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and &#946;-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) inhibitory activities.

In the second research scenario, the easy availability of EVs in body fluids and the specificity of their cargo, which can reflect the cell of origin or disease profiles, turn these into attractive diagnostic tools. EVs with exosome-like characteristics, circulating in the bloodstream and other peripheral biofluids, constitute a non-invasive and rapid alternative to study several conditions, including brain-related disorders. In both cases, several EVs isolation methods are already available, but each neuronal model or biofluid presents its own challenges. Herein, a literature overview on EVs isolation methodologies from distinct neuronal models (cellular culture and brain tissue) and body fluids (serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and saliva) was carried out. Focus was given to approaches employed in the context of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and the main research findings discussed. The topics here revised will facilitate the choice of EVs isolation methodologies and potentially prompt new discoveries in EVs research and in the neurodegenerative diseases field.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

A population of neurons, termed engram cells, represents the physiological manifestation of a specific memory trace and is characterized by dynamic changes in gene expression, which in turn alters the synaptic connectivity and excitability of these cells. Recent applications of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) are promising approaches for delineating the dynamic expression profiles in these subsets of neurons, and thus understanding memory-specific genes, their combinatorial patterns and regulatory networks. The aim of this article is to review and discuss the experimental and computational procedures of sc/snRNA-seq, new studies of molecular mechanisms of memory aided by sc/snRNA-seq in human brain diseases and related mouse models, and computational challenges in understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying long-term memory formation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022.

While amyloid-&#946; plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain define AD proteinopathy, it has become evident that diverse coding and non-coding regions of the genome may significantly contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy. In this review, we lay the current perspectives on the principal genetic factors associated with AD and the potential causes, highlighting the contribution of somatic mutations to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease. The roles that artificial intelligence and big data can play in accelerating the progress of causal somatic mutation markers/biomarkers identification, and the associated drug discovery/repurposing, have been highlighted for future AD and other neurodegenerative studies, with the aim to bring hope for the vulnerable aging population.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>This paper suggests a chemical mechanism for the earliest stages of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow stresses provide the energy needed to induce molecular conformation changes leading to AD by initiating amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) and tau aggregation. Shear and extensional flow stresses initiate aggregation in the laboratory and in natural biophysical processes. Energy-rich CSF flow regions are mainly found in lower brain regions. MRI studies reveal flow stress \"hot spots\" in basal cisterns and brain ventricles that have chaotic flow properties that can distort molecules such as A&#946; and tau trapped in these regions into unusual conformations. Such fluid disturbance is surrounded by tissue deformation. There is strong mapping overlap between the locations of these hot spots and of early-stage AD pathology. Our mechanism creates pure and mixed protein dimers, followed by tissue surface adsorption, and long-term tissue agitation ultimately inducing chemical reactions forming more stable, toxic oligomer seeds that initiate AD. It is proposed that different flow stress energies and flow types in different basal brain regions produce different neurotoxic aggregates. Proliferating artery hardening is responsible for enhanced heart systolic pulses that drive energetic CSF pulses, whose critical maximum systolic pulse energy location migrates further from the heart with increasing vascular disease. Two glymphatic systems, carotid and basilar, are suggested to contain the earliest A&#946; and tau AD disease pathologies. A key to the proposed AD mechanism is a comparison of early chronic traumatic encephalopathy and AD pathologies. Experiments that test the proposed mechanism are needed.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The propagation of NFT follows neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that synaptically connected neurons could transmit tau pathology by the recruitment of normal tau in a prion-like manner. Moreover, the intracerebral injection of pathological tau from AD brains induces the seeding of normal tau in mouse brain. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease has been transmitted after ocular transplants of cornea or sclera and the scrapie agent can spread across the retino-tectal pathway after intraocular injection of scrapie mouse brain homogenates. In AD, a tau pathology has been detected in the retina. To investigate the potential risk of tau pathology transmission during eye surgery using AD tissue material, we have analysed the development of tau pathology in the visual pathway of mice models expressing murine tau, wild-type or mutant human tau after intraocular injection of pathological tau proteins from AD brains. Although these pathological tau proteins were internalized in retinal ganglion cells, they did not induce aggregation of endogenous tau nor propagation of a tau pathology in the retino-tectal pathway after a 6-month incubation period. These results suggest that retinal ganglion cells exhibit a resistance to develop a tau pathology, and that eye surgery is not a major iatrogenic risk of transmission of tau pathology, contrary to what has been observed for transmission of infectious prions in prion diseases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

Impeding the formation of A&#946; &#946;-structure-rich aggregates and dissociating A&#946; fibrils are considered potent strategies to suppress the onset and progression of AD. As a molecular chaperone, human &#945;B-crystallin has received extensive attention in the inhibition of protein aggregation. Previous experiments reported that the structured core region of &#945;B-crystallin (&#945;BC) exhibits a better preventive effect on A&#946; aggregation and toxicity than the full-length protein. However, the molecular mechanism behind the effect of inhibition remains mostly unknown. Herein, we carried out six 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of &#945;BC on A&#946;<sub>42</sub> aggregation. Our simulations show that &#945;BC greatly impedes the formation of &#946;-structure contents. We find that the binding of &#945;BC to the A&#946;<sub>42</sub> monomer is driven by polar, hydrophobic, and H-bonding interactions. To explore whether &#945;BC could destabilize A&#946;<sub>42</sub> protofibrils, we also carried out MD simulations of A&#946;<sub>42</sub> protofibrils with and without &#945;BC. The results show that &#945;BC interacts with three binding sites of the A&#946;<sub>42</sub> protofibril, and the binding is mainly driven by polar and H-bonding interactions. The binding of &#945;BC at these three sites has a preferred dissociation effect on the &#946;-structure content, kink angle, and K28-A42 salt bridges. Overall, this study not only discloses the molecular mechanism of &#945;BC against A&#946;<sub>42</sub> aggregation but also demonstrates the disruption effects of &#945;BC on A&#946;<sub>42</sub> protofibrils, which yields an avenue for designing anti-AD drug candidates.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Neuroinflammation has become the third hallmark of AD, together with Amyloid-&#946; plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau protein. This review aims to broadly and extensively describe the differential aspects concerning apoE. Starting from the evolution of apoE to how APOE's single-nucleotide polymorphisms affect its structure, function, and involvement during health and disease. This review reflects on how APOE's polymorphisms impact critical aspects of AD pathology, such as the neuroinflammatory response, particularly the effect of APOE on astrocytic and microglial function and microglial dynamics, synaptic function, amyloid-&#946; load, tau pathology, autophagy, and cell-cell communication. We discuss influential factors affecting AD pathology combined with the APOE genotype, such as sex, age, diet, physical exercise, current therapies and clinical trials in the AD field. The impact of the APOE genotype in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overt inflammation, e.g., alpha- synucleinopathies and Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is also addressed.

In parallel, a series of studies showed that, under both homeostatic and pathological conditions, microglia are a heterogeneous cell population. In AD, amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) plaque-associated microglia (PAM) display a clearly distinct phenotype compared to plaque-distant microglia (PCM), suggesting that these two microglia subtypes likely differently contribute to disease progression. So far, molecular characterization of PAM was performed indirectly using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches or based on markers that are supposedly up-regulated in this microglia subpopulation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">In this study based on a well-characterized AD mouse model, we combined cell-specific laser capture&#160;microdissection and RNA-seq analysis to i) identify, without preconceived notions of the molecular and/or functional changes that would affect these cells, the genes and gene networks that are dysregulated in PAM or PCM at three critical stages of the disease, and ii) to investigate the potential contribution of both plaque-associated and plaque-distant microglia.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">First, we established that our approach allows selective isolation of microglia, while preserving spatial information and preventing transcriptome changes induced by classical purification approaches. Then, we identified, in PAM and PCM subpopulations, networks of co-deregulated genes and analyzed their potential functional roles in AD. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of microglia transcriptomic remodeling at early, intermediate and late stages of the disease&#160;and validated select findings in postmortem human AD brain.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our comprehensive study provides useful transcriptomic information regarding the respective contribution of PAM and PCM across the A&#946; pathology progression. It highlights specific pathways that would require further study to decipher their roles across disease&#160;progression. It demonstrates that the proximity of microglia to A&#946;-plaques dramatically alters the microglial transcriptome and reveals that these changes can have both positive and negative impacts on the surrounding cells. These opposing effects may be driven by local microglia heterogeneity also demonstrated by this study. Our approach leads to molecularly define the less well studied plaque-distant microglia. We show that plaque-distant microglia are not bystanders of the disease, although the transcriptomic changes are far less striking compared to what is observed in plaque-associated microglia. In particular, our results suggest they may be involved in A&#946; oligomer detection and in A&#946;-plaque initiation, with increased contribution as the disease progresses.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The identification of biomarkers based on risk factors for AD provides insight into the disease since the exact cause of AD remains unknown. Several studies have proposed microRNAs (miRNAs) in blood as potential biomarkers for AD. Exposure to heavy metals is a potential risk factor for onset and development of AD. Blood cells of subjects that are exposed to lead detected in the circulatory system, potentially reflect molecular responses to this exposure that are similar to the response of neurons. In this study we analyzed blood cell-derived miRNAs derived from a general population as proxies of potentially AD-related mechanisms triggered by lead exposure. Subsequently, we analyzed these mechanisms in the brain tissue of AD subjects and controls. A total of four miRNAs were identified as lead exposure-associated with hsa-miR-3651, hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-664b-3p being negatively and hsa-miR-627 positively associated. In human brain derived from AD and AD control subjects all four miRNAs were detected. Moreover, two miRNAs (miR-3651, miR-664b-3p) showed significant differential expression in AD brains versus controls, in accordance with the change direction of lead exposure. The miRNAs' gene targets were validated for expression in the human brain and were found enriched in AD-relevant pathways such as axon guidance. Moreover, we identified several AD relevant transcription factors such as CREB1 associated with the identified miRNAs. These findings suggest that the identified miRNAs are involved in the development of AD and might be useful in the development of new, less invasive biomarkers for monitoring of novel therapies or of processes involved in AD development.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Only 5% of AD cases are familial making it difficult to predict who will develop the disease thereby hindering our ability to treat the causes of the disease. A large population who almost certainly will, are those with Down syndrome (DS), who have a 90% lifetime incidence of AD. DS is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 resulting in three copies of APP and other AD-associated genes, like dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) overexpression. This implies that DYRK1a inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for DS and AD, however It is not clear how overexpression of each of these genes contributes to the pathology of each disease as well as how effective a DYRK1A inhibitor would be at suppressing any of these. To address this knowledge gap, we used Drosophila models with human Tau, human amyloid-&#946; or fly DYRK1A (minibrain (mnb)) neuronal overexpression resulting in photoreceptor neuron degeneration, premature death, decreased locomotion, sleep and memory loss. DYRK1A small molecule Type 1 kinase inhibitors (DYR219 and DYR533) were effective at suppressing these disease relevant phenotypes confirming their therapeutic potential.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Familial Alzheimer\\'s disease (FAD) mutations of the amyloid &#946;-peptide (A&#946;) are known to lead to early onset and more aggressive Alzheimer\\'s disease. FAD mutations such as \"Iowa\" (D23N), \"Arctic\" (E22G), \"Italian\" (E22K), and \"Dutch\" (E22Q) have been shown to accelerate A&#946; aggregation relative to the wild-type (WT). The mechanism by which these mutations facilitate increased aggregation is unknown, but each mutation results in a change in the net charge of the peptide. Previous studies have used nonpolarizable force fields to study A&#946;, providing some insight into how this protein unfolds. However, nonpolarizable force fields have fixed charges that lack the ability to redistribute in response to changes in local electric fields. Here, we performed polarizable molecular dynamics simulations on the full-length A&#946;<sub>42</sub> of WT and FAD mutations and calculated folding free energies of the A&#946;<sub>15-27</sub> fragment via umbrella sampling. By studying both the full-length A&#946;<sub>42</sub> and a fragment containing mutations and the central hydrophobic cluster (residues 17-21), we were able to systematically study how these FAD mutations impact secondary and tertiary structure and the thermodynamics of folding. Electrostatic interactions, including those between permanent and induced dipoles, affected side-chain properties, salt bridges, and solvent interactions. The FAD mutations resulted in shifts in the electronic structure and solvent accessibility at the central hydrophobic cluster and the hydrophobic C-terminal region. Using umbrella sampling, we found that the folding of the WT and E22 mutants is enthalpically driven, whereas the D23N mutant is entropically driven, arising from a different unfolding pathway and peptide-bond dipole response. Together, the unbiased, full-length, and umbrella sampling simulations of fragments reveal that the FAD mutations perturb nearby residues and others in hydrophobic regions to potentially alter solubility. These results highlight the role electronic polarizability plays in amyloid misfolding and the role of heterogeneous microenvironments that arise as conformational change takes place.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The KD resulted in a tissue specific increase in mitochondrial mass and kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) levels in the GTN and soleus muscles, with a corresponding decrease in kynurenine and increase in kynurenic acid levels in serum. With KAT proteins being responsible for converting kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which is unable to cross the blood brain barrier and be turned into quinolinic acid-a potent neurotoxin, this study provides a potential mechanism of crosstalk between muscle and brain in mice on a KD that may contribute to improved cognitive function in middle-aged female mice.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Nootropics, also called \"smart drugs\", are used for the treatment of cognitive deficits. In this work, we evaluate the neuroprotective action of four memantine analogues of glycine derivatives, including glycyl-glycine, glycyl-glycyl-glycine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine and three conjugates with nootropics, modafinil, piracetam and picamilon. The new structural memantine derivatives improved cell viability against copper-induced neurotoxicity in APPswe cells and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Among these novel compounds, modafinil-memantine, piracetam-memantine, sarcosine-memantine, dimethylglycine-memantine, and glycyl-glycine-memantine were demonstrated with good EC<sub>50</sub> values of the protective effects on APPswe cells, accompanied with moderate amelioration from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that novel structural derivatives of memantine might have the potential to develop promising lead compounds for the treatment of AD. The solubility of memantine analogues with nootropics and memantine analogues with glycine derivatives in buffer solutions at pH 2.0 and pH 7.4 simulating the biological media at 298.15 K was determined and the mutual influence of the structural fragments in the molecules on the solubility behavior was analyzed.

Emerging evidence highlighted that hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance represent risk factors for AD development, thus suggesting the existence of an additional AD form, associated with glucose metabolism impairment, named type 3 diabetes. Owing to the limited pharmacological options, novel strategies, especially dietary approaches based on the consumption of polyphenols, have been addressed to prevent or, at least, slow down AD progression. Among polyphenols, ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative, widely distributed in nature, especially in cereal bran and fruits, and known to be endowed with many bioactivities, especially antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic, thus suggesting it could be exploited as a possible novel neuroprotective strategy. Considering the importance of ferulic acid as a bioactive molecule and its widespread distribution in foods and medicinal plants, the aim of the present narrative review is to provide an overview on the existing preclinical and clinical evidence about the neuroprotective properties and mechanisms of action of ferulic acid, also focusing on its ability to modulate glucose homeostasis, in order to support a further therapeutic interest for AD and type 3 diabetes.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

In some neurological disorders, known as tauopathies, tau is dissociated from the microtubule and forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. Tau comprises four pseudorepeats (R1-R4), containing one (R1, R2, R4) or two (R3) histidines, that potentially act as metal binding sites. Moreover, Cys291 and Cys322 in R2 and R3, respectively, might have an important role in protein aggregation, through possible disulfide bond formation, and/or affecting the binding and reactivity of redox-active metal ions, as copper. We, therefore, compare the interaction of copper with octadeca-R3-peptide (R3C) and with the mutant containing an alanine residue (R3A) to assess the role of thiol group. Spectrophotometric titrations allow to calculate the formation constant of the copper(I) complexes, showing a remarkable stronger interaction in the case of R3C (log <i>K</i><sub>f</sub> = 13.4 and 10.5 for copper(I)-R3C and copper(I)-R3A, respectively). We also evaluate the oxidative reactivity associated to these copper complexes in the presence of dopamine and ascorbate. Both R3A and R3C peptides increase the capability of copper to oxidize catechols, but copper-R3C displays a peculiar mechanism due to the presence of cysteine. HPLC-MS analysis shows that cysteine can form disulfide bonds and dopamine-Cys covalent adducts, with potential implication in tau aggregation process.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Most cases of AD are sporadic, and very few are inherited; the pathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and remains to be elucidated. The asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain is the only recognized cysteine protease that specifically hydrolyzes peptide bonds after asparagine residues in mammals. The expression level of AEPs in healthy brains is far lower than that of peripheral organs. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that aging may upregulate and overactivate brain AEPs. The overactivation of AEPs drives the onset of AD through cleaving tau and amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and SET, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The AEP-mediated cleavage of these peptides enhances amyloidosis, promotes tau hyperphosphorylation, and ultimately induces neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Upregulated AEPs and related deleterious reactions constitute upstream events of amyloid/tau toxicity in the brain, and represent early pathological changes in AD. Thus, upregulated AEPs are an emerging drug target for disease modification and a potential biomarker for predicting preclinical AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier greatly hinders establishing body-fluid-based methods to measure brain AEPs. Research on AEP-activity-based imaging probes and our recent work suggest that the live brain imaging of AEPs could be used to evaluate its predictive efficacy as an AD biomarker. To advance translational research in this area, AEP imaging probes applicable to human brain and AEP inhibitors with good druggability are urgently needed.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The individual level SNP-QT signals are high dimensional and typically have small effect sizes, making them hard to be detected and replicated. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a new approach that identifies high-level imaging genetic associations through applying multigraph clustering to the SNP-QT association maps. Given an SNP set and a brain QT set, the association between each SNP and each QT is evaluated using a linear regression model. Based on the resulting SNP-QT association map, five SNP-SNP similarity networks (or graphs) are created using five different scoring functions, respectively. Multigraph clustering is applied to these networks to identify SNP clusters with similar association patterns with all the brain QTs. After that, functional annotation is performed for each identified SNP cluster and its corresponding brain association pattern. We applied this pipeline to an AD imaging genetic study, which yielded promising results. For example, in an association study between 54 AD SNPs and 116 amyloid QTs, we identified two SNP clusters with one responsible for amyloid beta clearances and the other regulating amyloid beta formation. These high-level findings have the potential to provide valuable insights into relevant genetic pathways and brain circuits, which can help form new hypotheses for more detailed imaging and genetics studies in independent cohorts.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

In the present study, we explored the impacts of PGC-1a on AD pathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction and its potential mechanisms with a particular focus on mitochondrial dynamics. Paralleling AD-related pathological deposits, neuronal apoptosis, abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and lowered membrane potential, a remarkable reduction in the expression of PGC-1a was shown in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice at 6 months of age. By infusing AAV-<i>Ppargc1&#945;</i> into the lateral parietal association (LPtA) cortex of the APP/PS1 brain, we found that PGC-1a ameliorated AD-like behavioral abnormalities, such as deficits in spatial reference memory, working memory and sensorimotor gating. Notably, overexpressed PGC-1a in LPtA rescued mitochondrial swelling and damage in neurons, likely through correcting the altered balance in mitochondrial fission-fusion and its abnormal distribution. Our findings support the notion that abnormal mitochondrial dynamics is likely an important mechanism that leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and AD-related pathological and cognitive impairments, and they indicate the potential value of PGC-1a for restoring mitochondrial dynamics as an innovative therapeutic target for AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Cortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability intervenes in the pathological derangement of brain activity leading to cognitive decline. As key regulators of neuronal excitability, the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>V</sub>) might play a crucial role in the AD pathophysiology. Among them, the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 channel, the main &#945; subunit mediating the delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>DR</sub>) and controlling the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, has been poorly examined in AD. In the present study, we investigated the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 protein expression and activity in hippocampal neurons from the Tg2576 mouse, a widely used transgenic model of AD. To this aim we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our Western blotting results reveal that K<sub>V</sub>2.1 was overexpressed in the hippocampus of 3-month-old Tg2576 mice and in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 mouse embryos compared with the WT counterparts. Electrophysiological experiments unveiled that the whole I<sub>DR</sub> were reduced in the Tg2576 primary neurons compared with the WT neurons, and that this reduction was due to the loss of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 current component. Moreover, we found that the reduction of the K<sub>V</sub>2.1-mediated currents was due to increased channel clustering, and that glutamate, a stimulus inducing K<sub>V</sub>2.1 declustering, was able to restore the I<sub>DR</sub> to levels comparable to those of the WT neurons. These findings add new information about the dysregulation of ionic homeostasis in the Tg2576 AD mouse model and identify K<sub>V</sub>2.1 as a possible player in the AD-related alterations of neuronal excitability.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Though efforts continue towards broadening and deepening our knowledge and understanding of the mechanistic and neuropathological underpinnings of AD, our previous failures motivate a re-examination of how we conceptualize AD pathology and progression. In addition to not yielding effective treatments, the phenotypically heterogeneous biological processes that have been the primary area of focus to date have not been adequately shown to be necessary or sufficient to explain the risk and progression of AD. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that lifestyle and environment represent the ultimate level of causation for AD and age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, the decline in cognitive demands over the lifespan plays a central role in driving the structural and functional deteriorations of the brain. In the absence of adequate cognitive stimulus, physiological demand-function coupling leads to downregulation of growth, repair, and homeostatic processes, resulting in deteriorating brain tissue health, function, and capacity. In this setting, the heterogeneity of associated neuropathological tissue hallmarks then occurs as a consequence of an individual\\'s genetic and environmental background and are best considered downstream markers of the disease process rather than specific targets for direct intervention. In this manuscript we outline the evidence for a demand-driven model of age-related cognitive decline and dementia and why it mandates a holistic approach to dementia treatment and prevention that incorporates the primary upstream role of cognitive demand.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Even though a bulk of evidence has uncovered the role of metals in the generation of the toxic pathways at the base of Alzheimer's disease (AD), this matter has been sidelined by the advent of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis. However, the link between metals and AD has been investigated in the last two decades, focusing on their local accumulation in brain areas known to be critical for AD. Recent evidence revealed a relation between iron and AD, particularly in relation to its capacity to increase the risk of the disease through ferroptosis. In this review, we briefly summarize the major points characterizing the function of iron in our body and highlight why, even though it is essential for our life, we have to monitor its dysfunction, particularly if we want to control our risk of AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The present study aims to examine the spreading of P301S aggregated tau, a mutation that is implicated in tauopathies, using organotypic slice cultures. Coronal hippocampal organotypic brain slices (170 &#181;m) were prepared from postnatal (day 8-10) C57BL6 wild-type mice. Collagen hydrogels loaded with P301S aggregated tau were applied to slices and the spread of tau was assessed by immunohistochemistry after 8 weeks in culture. Collagen hydrogels prove to be an effective protein delivery system subject to natural degradation in 14 days and they release tau proteins up to 8 weeks. Slices with un- and hyperphosphorylated P301S aggregated tau demonstrate significant spreading to the ventral parts of the hippocampal slices compared to empty collagen hydrogels after 8 weeks. Moreover, the spread of P301S aggregated tau occurs in a time-dependent manner, which was interrupted when the neuroanatomical pathways are lesioned. We illustrate that the spreading of tau can be investigated in organotypic slice cultures using collagen hydrogels to achieve a localized application and slow release of tau proteins. P301S aggregated tau significantly spreads to the ventral areas of the slices, suggesting that the disease-relevant aggregated tau form possesses spreading potential. Thus, the results offer a novel experimental approach to investigate tau pathology.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The protective factors (20%) were mainly related to lifestyle, pointing to the Mediterranean diet, regular physical activity, and cognitively stimulating activities. Social factors constituted 9.6% of all identified factors. Research on biological and medical factors dominates the reviewed literature. Greater social support and frequent contact may confer some protection against cognitive decline and dementia by delaying its onset or reducing the overall risk; however, overall, our findings are inconsistent.

This transient over-activation of mGluR signalling is coupled with impaired LTP and shifts the dynamic range of synapses towards depression.

Although three major genes have been identified as causative, the genetic contribution to the disease remains unsolved in many patients. Recent studies have identified pathogenic variants in genes representing a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in causative genes for other degenerative dementias as responsible for EOAD. To study them further, we investigated a panel of candidate genes in 102 Italian EOAD patients, 45.10% of whom had a positive family history and 21.74% with a strong family history of dementia. We found that 10.78% of patients carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, including a novel variant, in <i>PSEN1</i>, <i>PSEN2</i>, or <i>APP</i>, and 7.84% showed homozygosity for the &#949;4 <i>APOE</i> allele. Additionally, 7.84% of patients had a moderate risk allele in <i>PSEN1</i>, <i>PSEN2</i>, or <i>TREM2</i> genes. Besides, we observed that 12.75% of our patients carried only a variant in genes associated with other neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of these variants contributes to explain 46% of cases with a definite familiarity and 32% of sporadic forms.

Thus, we determined the impact of amyloid-&#946; (A&#946;) pathology in GIRK channel density, subcellular distribution, and its association with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from the APP/PS1 mouse model using quantitative SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labelling (SDS-FRL) and proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA). In wild type mice, single SDS-FRL detection revealed a similar dendritic gradient for GIRK1 and GIRK2 in CA1 pyramidal cells, with higher densities in spines, and GIRK3 showed a lower and uniform distribution. Double SDS-FRL showed a co-clustering of GIRK2 and GIRK1 in post- and presynaptic compartments, but not for GIRK2 and GIRK3. Likewise, double GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GIRK2 SDS-FRL detection displayed a high degree of co-clustering in nanodomains (40-50 nm) mostly in spines and axon terminals. In APP/PS1 mice, the density of GIRK2 and GIRK1, but not for GIRK3, was significantly reduced along the neuronal surface of CA1 pyramidal cells and in axon terminals contacting them. Importantly, GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GIRK2 co-clustering was not present in APP/PS1 mice. Similarly, P-LISA experiments revealed a significant reduction in GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GIRK2 interaction on the hippocampus of this animal model. Overall, our results provide compelling evidence showing a significant reduction on the cell surface density of pre- and postsynaptic GIRK1 and GIRK2, but not GIRK3, and a decline in GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and GIRK2 channels co-clustering in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from APP/PS1 mice, thus suggesting that a disruption in the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-GIRK channel membrane assembly causes dysregulation in the GABA<sub>B</sub> signalling via GIRK channels in this AD animal model.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, astroglial reactivity is typical of brain pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering the heterogeneity of the reactive response, the role of astrocytes in the course of different forms of AD has been underestimated. Colombia has the largest human group known to have familial AD (FAD). This group carries the autosomal dominant and fully penetrant mutation E280A in PSEN1, which causes early-onset AD. Recently, our group identified an E280A carrier who did not develop FAD. The individual was homozygous for the Christchurch mutation R136S in APOE3 (APOEch). Remarkably, APOE is the main genetic risk factor for developing sporadic AD (SAD) and most of cerebral ApoE is produced by astroglia. Here, we characterized astrocyte properties related to reactivity, glutamate homeostasis, and structural integrity of the gliovascular unit (GVU), as factors that could underlie the pathogenesis or protection of AD. Specifically, through histological and 3D microscopy analyses of postmortem samples, we briefly describe the histopathology and cytoarchitecture of the frontal cortex of SAD, FAD, and APOEch, and demonstrate that, while astrodegeneration and vascular deterioration are prominent in SAD, FAD is characterized by hyperreactive-like glia, and APOEch displays the mildest astrocytic and vascular alterations despite having the highest burden of A&#946;. Notably, astroglial, gliovascular, and vascular disturbances, as well as brain cell death, correlate with the specific astrocytic phenotypes identified in each condition.

Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and &#946;III-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. &#946;III-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls. These findings indicate that factors besides transcriptional regulation cause increases in caspase-2 protein levels. The reduction of SNAP25 mRNA expression suggests that presynaptic dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurodegeneration.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Chronic high blood pressure continuously challenges the structural and functional integrity of the cerebral vasculature, leading to microvascular rarefaction and dysfunction, and neurovascular uncoupling that typically impairs cerebral blood supply. Hypertension disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, promotes neuroinflammation, and may contribute to amyloid deposition and Alzheimer pathology. The mechanisms underlying these harmful effects are still a focus of investigation, but studies in animal models have provided significant molecular and cellular mechanistic insights. Remaining questions relate to whether adequate treatment of hypertension may prevent deterioration of cognitive function, the threshold for blood pressure treatment, and the most effective antihypertensive drugs. Recent advances in neurovascular biology, advanced brain imaging, and detection of subtle behavioral phenotypes have begun to provide insights into these critical issues. Importantly, a parallel analysis of these parameters in animal models and humans is feasible, making it possible to foster translational advancements.

To date, there is little evidence on whether gait is altered in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We aimed to identify impairments in gait performance and associations between gait impairment and neuroimaging markers of CAA, cognition, and falls. Methods and Results Gait was assessed using the Zeno Walkway during preferred pace and dual task walks, and grouped into gait domains (Rhythm, Pace, Postural Control, and Variability). Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. Falls and fear of falling were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Gait domain scores were standardized and analyzed using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, height, and other covariates. Participants were patients with CAA (n=29), Alzheimer disease with mild dementia (n=16), mild cognitive impairment (n=24), and normal elderly controls (n=47). CAA and Alzheimer disease had similarly impaired Rhythm, Pace, and Variability, and higher dual task cost than normal controls or mild cognitive impairment. Higher Pace score was associated with better global cognition, processing speed, and memory. Gait measures were not correlated with microbleed count or white matter hyperintensity volume. Number of falls was not associated with gait domain scores, but participants with low fear of falling had higher Pace (odds ratio [OR], 2.61 [95% CI, 1.59-4.29]) and lower Variability (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.10-2.44]). Conclusions CAA is associated with slower walking, abnormal rhythm, and greater gait variability than in healthy controls. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying gait impairments in CAA, and whether they predict future falls.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Conversely, PTP1B inhibition has been shown to prevent microglial activation, thus exerting a potent anti-inflammatory effect and has also shown potential to increase the cognitive process through the stimulation of hippocampal insulin, leptin and BDNF/TrkB receptors. Notwithstanding, most research on the clinical efficacy of targeting PTP1B has been developed in the field of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M). However, despite the link existing between these metabolic alterations and neurodegeneration, no clinical trials assessing the neurological advantages of PTP1B inhibition have been performed yet. Preclinical studies, though, have provided strong evidence that targeting PTP1B could allow to reach different pathophysiological mechanisms at once. herefore, specific interventions or trials should be designed to modulate PTP1B activity in brain, since it is a promising strategy to decelerate or prevent neurodegeneration in aged individuals, among other neurological diseases.

Superhydrophilic polyethyleneimine (PEI) was introduced, to which a phosphonate-functionalized ionic liquid (PFIL) was covalently bound, to form superhydrophilic and cationic surface layers with high densities of nitrogen atoms, phosphonate functional groups, and high-loading metal ions. Due to the combined features of superhydrophilicity, flexibility, highly dense metal binding sites, large surface area and excellent size-exclusion effect, the fabricated nanocomposite G@mSiO<sub>2</sub>@PEI-PFIL-Ti<sup>4+</sup> exhibits superior detection sensitivity to enrich phosphopeptides (tryptic &#946;-casein digest, 0.1 fmol), and extraordinary enrichment specificity to enrich phosphopeptides from a digest mixture of &#946;-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (molar ratio, 1&#8201;:&#8201;12&#8201;000). The excellent size-exclusion effect was also observed, and 27 endogenous phosphopeptides were identified in human saliva. All these results could be attributed to the unique superhydrophilic nanocomposite structure with a high density of a cationic linker modified with phosphonate functionality. Moreover, G@mSiO<sub>2</sub>@PEI-PFIL-Ti<sup>4+</sup> adsorbents were used to extract phosphopeptides from the tryptic digests of hippocampal lysates for quantitative phosphoproteome analysis. The preliminary results indicate that 1649 phosphoproteins, 3286 phosphopeptides and 4075 phosphorylation sites were identified. A total of 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related phosphopeptides within tau proteins were detected with a wide coverage from p-Thr111 to p-Ser404, in which the amounts of some phoshopeptides at certain sites in AD transgenic mice were found statistically higher than those in wild type littermates. Besides, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains, a potential biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, were also identified. Finally, the adsorbent was applied to human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples. 5 unique phosphopeptides of neuroendocrine specific VGF were identified in the CSF, while many phosphopeptides originated from the nervous system were found in the blood sample. All these results suggest that our new IMAC materials exhibit unbiased enrichment ability with superior detection sensitivity and specificity, allowing the global phosphoproteome analysis of complicated biological samples more convincible and indicating the potential use in disease diagnosis.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength and 5-times sit-to-stand time and 6-m gait speed were used for assessing muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function, respectively. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale (MoCA), Memory and Executive Screening Scale (MES), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Digital Span Test (DST) and Verbal Fluency Task (VFT), respectively. DST included Forward Digit Span Test (FDST) and Backward Digit Span Test (BDST). All the subjects underwent 3.0T coronal three-dimensional gradient echo sequence MRI. MTA scale was performed to evaluate the degree of medial temporal lobe atrophy. The differences in the sarcopenia-related indicators, cognitive score and MTA score were analyzed among the three groups, and the partial correlation analysis was performed between the inter-groups. <b>Results:</b> Eighty AD patients (24 males and 56 females) were included, aged (72&#177;7) years old, with 41 mild and 39 moderate patients. Meanwhile, 43 NC included 19 males and 24 females, with a mean age of (70&#177;6) years old. The disease duration in moderate AD patients was longer than that of mild AD patients [34.0 (25.0, 43.5) months vs 24.0 (11.0, 34.0) months, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001]. The differences of sarcopenia-related indicators and MTA score among the three groups were statistically significant (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), including 5-times sit-to-stand time [(13.6&#177;1.8) s vs (11.5&#177;1.7) s vs (10.3&#177;1.9) s, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001] and MTA score [2.0 (2.0, 3.0) vs 1.0 (1.0, 2.0) vs 0 (0, 0), <i>P</i>&lt;0.001]. In neuropsychological tests, compared to the NC group, MMSE, MoCA, MES and VFT scores in mild and moderate AD groups were lower (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001); meanwhile, compared to the mild AD group, the moderate group had lower MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST and VFT scores (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). In sarcopenia-related indicators, muscle strength in particular was correlated with widespread cognitive functioning domains and MTA score in AD patients. Grip strength was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA , MES, FDST (<i>r</i>=0.387, 0.418, 0.522 and 0.484, respectively, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), DSST (<i>r</i>=0.327, <i>P</i>=0.006) and VFT score (<i>r</i>=0.354, <i>P</i>=0.003), and negatively correlated with MTA score (<i>r</i>=-0.631, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). 5-times sit-to-stand time was negatively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST, VFT score (<i>r</i>=-0.583, -0.587, -0.814, -0.591, -0.552 and -0.485, respectively, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and BDST (<i>r</i>=-0.355, <i>P</i>=0.003) strongly positively correlated with MTA score (<i>r</i>=0.836, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). ASMI was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (<i>r</i>=0.257, 0.238, 0.428, 0.282 and 0.364, respectively, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and negatively correlated with MTA score (<i>r</i>=-0.377, <i>P</i>=0.001). 6-m gait speed was positively correlated with MMSE, MoCA, MES, DSST, FDST score (<i>r</i>=0.419, 0.486, 0.699, 0.559 and 0.500, respectively, all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), BDST and VFT score (<i>r</i>=0.384&#12289;0.377, respectively, both <i>P</i>=0.001), and strongly negatively correlated with MTA score (<i>r</i>=-0.803, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with mild to moderate AD have widespread cognitive impairment.

Aerobic exercise (AE) enhances learning and memory, improves cognitive impairment, increases telomere binding protein expression, and decreases apoptosis regulators, but it remains unclear whether it can improve cognitive impairment caused by neuronal apoptosis in AD. Therefore, this study investigated whether an 8-week running table exercise intervention could reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in the hippocampal neurons of AD model mice. After the exercise intervention, we evaluated the learning memory ability (positioning, navigation, and spatial search) of mice using a Morris water labyrinth, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and protein application to detect hippocampal PI3K/Akt/GSK-3<i>&#946;</i> signaling pathway protein and hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-promoting protein bcl-2-related X (Bax) protein expression. The results showed that aerobic exercise improved the location and spatial exploration ability of mice, increased the number of PI3K- and p-Akt-positive cells, increased the expression of PI3K, p-Akt, and bcl-2 proteins, decreased the expression of GSK-3<i>&#946;</i> and Bax proteins, and increased the bcl-2/Bax ratio of mice. The results suggest that aerobic exercise can reduce apoptosis and improve cognitive function in AD mice.

The dedicatedly-designed base classifiers can make use of the heterogeneous data, and empower the framework with enhanced diversity and robustness. In particular, to consider the interactions among the base classifiers, a novel multi-head self-attention voting scheme is designed. Moreover, considering the chance that MCI can be transformed to AD, the proposed framework is designed to diagnose AD and predict MCI conversion simultaneously, with the aid of the transfer learning technique.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">For performance evaluation and comparison, extensive experiments are conducted on the public dataset of the Alzheimer\\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

We map the GSM binding site to the enzyme-substrate interface, define a drug-binding mode that is consistent with functional and structural data, and provide molecular insights into the underlying mechanisms of action. In this respect, our analyses show that occupancy of a &#947;-secretase (sub)pocket, mediating binding of the modulator's imidazole moiety, is sufficient to trigger allosteric rearrangements in &#947;-secretase as well as stabilize enzyme-substrate interactions.

In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495. LY379268 was also able to block pathologic tau propagation between primary neurons in an in vitro microfluidic cellular model. These novel results are transformational for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating tau release and propagation at synaptic terminals in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that these processes could be inhibited therapeutically by the selective activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pathological tau release and propagation are key neuropathological events underlying cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. This paper describes the role of regulated exocytosis, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein SNAP25, in mediating tau release from rodent and human synaptosomes.

Using diffusion MRI (dMRI), we investigated the sensitivity of dMRI measures in capturing AD pathology associated microstructure alterations in older 3xTg-AD mice, and the degree to which dMRI changes correlate with measurements of A&#946; and tau pathology. 3xTg-AD and normal control (NC) mice, 15 to 21&#160;months of age, were used in this study. In vivo dMRI data were acquired for the generation of diffusion tensor (DT) and diffusional kurtosis (DK) measures within the hippocampus and fimbria (Fi). For these same brain regions, A&#946; and tau pathology were quantified by morphological analysis of A&#223;1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed to assess group differences in each brain region of interest (ROI), with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method being applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate associations between diffusion and morphological measures. Our results revealed, depending on the brain region, DT and DK measures were able to detect group differences. In the dorsal hippocampus (HD), fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly higher in the 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. In the subiculum (SUB), FA, axial diffusivity (D<sub>||</sub>) and radial kurtosis (K<sub>&#9524;</sub>) were significantly higher in 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. Morphological quantification of A&#223;1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity showed elevated A&#223; and tau in the Fi, ventral hippocampus (HV) and SUB of 3xTg-AD mice. The presence of A&#946; and tau was significantly correlated with several DT and DK measures, particularly in the SUB, where an increase in tau correlated with an increase in mean kurtosis (MK) and K<sub>&#9524;</sub>. This work demonstrates significant dMRI differences between older 3xTg-AD and NC mice in the hippocampus and Fi. Significant correlations were found between dMRI and morphological measures of A&#946; and tau pathology. These results support the potential of dMRI-derived parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology. Since the imaging methods employed here are easily translatable to clinical MRI, our results are also relevant for human AD patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It is not clear whether these abilities are also disturbed in other conditions with prominent frontal lobe involvement, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Our aim was to investigate social cognition (facial emotion recognition, recognition of social norms violation and mentalizing) in bvFTD and PSP. The neural basis of these functions in PSP and bvFTD groups, by analysis of structural neuroimaging, were also investigated. Twenty-three bvFTD patients, 21 PSP patients and 23 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent 3T brain MRI and a full cognitive exam including the short version of Social and Emotional Assessment (Mini-SEA), which is composed of a facial emotion recognition test (FERT) and the faux pas test. Two components of the faux pas test were distinguished: a score assessing the recognition of social norms violation and a score assessing mentalizing. Compared to controls, bvFTD and PSP patients had significantly reduced scores in all tests of social cognition but did not differ on these measures. PSP and bvFTD had cerebral atrophy in critical regions for social cognition processes, when compared to controls. The cortical correlates of emotion recognition partially overlapped in bvFTD and PSP, with correlations retrieved within the frontal medial cortex, cingulate, insula and limbic structures. PSP and bvFTD patients also displayed similar patterns of brain correlations for the composite score of social norms, with a significant cluster in anterior temporal lobes. Mentalizing scores were associated with frontal and temporal poles bilaterally, in both bvFTD and PSP. These findings support previous observations that PSP patients exhibit impairment in complex cognitive abilities, such as mentalizing. Moreover, these data extend previous findings showing that PSP and bvFTD share key clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging features.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Microglia, the first responders of the brain, are the drivers of this neuroinflammation. Microglial activation, leading to induction of pro-inflammatory factors, like Interleukin 1-&#946; (IL-1&#946;), Tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF&#945;), nitrites, and others, have been shown to induce neurodegeneration. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to reduce the risk of developing PD, but the mechanism underlying the microglial activation is still under active research. Recently, microglial ion channels have come to the forefront as potential drug targets in multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and PD. Microglia expresses a variety of ion channels, including potassium channels, calcium channels, chloride channels, sodium channels, and proton channels. The diversity of channels present on microglia is responsible for the dynamic nature of these immune cells of the brain. These ion channels regulate microglial proliferation, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antigen recognition and presentation, apoptosis, and cell signaling leading to inflammation, among other critical critical functions. Understanding the role of these ion channels and the signaling mechanism these channels regulate under pathological conditions is an active area of research. This review will be focusing on the roles of different microglial ion channels, and their potential role in regulating microglial functions in neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Author.

The PD-L1 undergoes multi-level regulations in tumor cells. Among them, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PD-L1 mainly including glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and palmitoylation, have attracted much attention in recent years.

Here, we investigate immunologic effects of metformin on natural killer (NK) and natural killer T cells, including results from two phase I open-label studies in patients with HNSCC treated with metformin (NCT02325401, NCT02083692).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Peripheral blood was collected before and after metformin treatment or from newly diagnosed patients with HNSCC. Peripheral immune cell phenotypes were evaluated using flow cytometry, cytokine expression by ELISA and/or IsoLight, and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was determined with a flow-based NK cell cytotoxicity assay (NKCA). Patient tumor immune infiltration before and after metformin treatment was analyzed with immunofluorescence. NK cells were treated with either vehicle or metformin and analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NK cells were then treated with inhibitors of significant pathways determined by RNA-seq and analyzed by NKCA, ELISA, and western blot analyses.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Increased peripheral NK cell activated populations were observed in patients treated with metformin. NK cell tumor infiltration was enhanced in patients with HNSCC treated with metformin preoperatively. Metformin increased antitumorigenic cytokines ex vivo, including significant increases in perforin. Metformin increased HNSCC NK cell cytotoxicity and inhibited the CXCL1 pathway while stimulating the STAT1 pathway within HNSCC NK cells. Exogenous CXCL1 prevented metformin-enhanced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Metformin-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity was found to be AMP-activated protein kinase independent, but dependent on both mechanistic target of rapamycin and pSTAT1.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our data identifies a new role for metformin-mediated immune antitumorigenic function through NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and downregulation of CXCL1 in HNSCC.

The Fast Real-time Assessment of Combination Therapies in Immuno-ONcology (FRACTION) program is an open-label, phase 2 platform trial designed to evaluate multiple IO combinations in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) who progressed during or after prior IO therapy. Here, we describe the results for patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab. For enrollment in track 2 (reported here), patients with histologically confirmed clear cell aRCC, Karnofsky performance status &#8805;70%, and life expectancy &#8805;3 months who had previously progressed after IO (anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)) therapy were eligible. Previous treatment with anti-CTLA-4 therapy plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy precluded eligibility for enrollment in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm. Patients were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 2 years or until progression, toxicity, or protocol-specified discontinuation. The primary outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were safety and tolerability up to 2 years. Overall survival (OS) was a tertiary/exploratory endpoint. Overall, 46 patients were included with a median follow-up of 33.8 months. The ORR was 17.4% (95% CI, 7.8 to 31.4) with eight (17.4%) patients achieving partial response. Stable disease was achieved in 19 (41.3%) patients, while 14 (30.4%) had progressive disease. Median DOR (range) was 16.4 (2.1+ to 27.0+) months. The PFS rate at 24 weeks was 43.2%, and median OS was 23.8 (95% CI, 13.2 to not reached) months. Grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events were reported in seven (15.2%) patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Patients with aRCC treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab may derive durable clinical benefit after progression on previous IO therapies, including heavily pretreated patients, with a manageable safety profile that was consistent with previously published safety outcomes. These outcomes contribute to the knowledge of optimal sequencing of IO therapies for patients with aRCC with high unmet needs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">NCT02996110.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

We previously showed that the N-terminal domain of EP400 increases the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer cells. As the EP400 N-terminal-Like (EP400NL) gene resides next to the EP400 gene locus, this prompted us to investigate whether EP400NL plays a similar role in transcriptional regulation to the full-length EP400 protein. We found that EP400NL forms a human NuA4-like chromatin remodelling complex that lacks both the TIP60 histone acetyltransferase and EP400 ATPase. However, this EP400NL complex displays H2A.Z deposition activity on a chromatin template comparable to the human NuA4 complex, suggesting another associated ATPase such as BRG1 or RuvBL1/RuvBL2 catalyses the reaction. We demonstrated that the transcriptional coactivator function of EP400NL is required for serum and IFN&#947;-induced PD-L1 gene activation. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicates that EP400NL contributes to cMyc-responsive mitochondrial biogenesis. Taken together, our studies show that EP400NL plays a role as a transcription coactivator of PD-L1 gene regulation and provides a potential target to modulate cMyc functions in cancer therapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Despite familiarity with factors affecting its etiology, initiation, progression, treatment strategies, and even resistance to therapy, it is considered a significant problem for women. However, several factors have greatly affected previous aspects affecting BC progression and treatment in the last decades. miRNAs are short non-coding RNA sequences that regulate gene expression by inhibiting the translation of the target mRNA. miRNAs play a crucial role in BC pathogenesis by promoting cancer stem cell (CSCs) proliferation, postponing apoptosis, continuing the cell cycle, and endorsing invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Similarly, miRNAs influence important BC-related molecular pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, the Wnt/&#946;-catenin system, JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, miRNAs affect the treatment response of BC to chemo and radiotherapy. Consequently, this review aims to provide an acquainted summary of oncomiRs and tumor suppressor (TS) miRNAs and their potential role in BC pathogenesis and therapy responses by focusing on the molecular pathways that drive them.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

PP2A is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP2A C&#945;/&#946;) and scaffolding subunit (PP2A A&#945;/&#946;) and various substrate-directing B regulatory subunits. PP2A biogenesis is regulated at multiple levels. For example, the sequestration of the free catalytic subunit during the process of biogenesis avoids promiscuous phosphatase activity. Post-translational modifications of PP2A C directs PP2A heterotrimeric formation. Additionally, PP2A functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, where attenuated PP2A enzymatic activity creates a permissive environment for oncogenic transformation. Recent work studying PP2A in cancer showed that its role in tumorigenesis is more nuanced, with some holoenzymes being tumor suppressive, while others are required for oncogenic transformation. In cancer biology, PP2A function is modulated through various mechanisms including the displacement of specific B regulatory subunits by DNA tumor viral antigens, by recurrent mutations, and through loss of carboxymethyl-sensitive heterotrimeric complexes. In aggregate, these alterations bias PP2A activity away from its tumor suppressive functions and towards oncogenic ones. From a therapeutic perspective, molecular glues, and disruptors present opportunities for both the selective stabilization of tumor suppressive holoenzymes and disruption of holoenzymes that are pro-oncogenic. Collectively, these approaches represent an attractive cancer therapy for a wide range of tumor types. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which PP2A holoenzyme formation is dysregulated in cancer and the current therapies that are aimed at biasing heterotrimer formation of PP2A for the treatment of cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

In vitro structural studies have shown that the IDR's dynamic reorganization around the catalytic domain, driven by electrostatic interactions, can lead to TC-PTP activity inhibition, however the process has not been studied in cells.

Our FRET-based assays in vitro and in cells confirmed that the effect of the mutant correlates with an impairment of the intramolecular inhibitory remodeling of TC-PTP by the IDR.

We used conventional pathology, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, Western blot and other techniques to study the therapeutic effect of GA on GPL and its possiblemechanism in vitro and in vivo.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">The results showed that compared with normal GES-1&#8239;cells, MC cells had the characteristics of malignant cells such as abnormal proliferation, invasion and metastasis, accompanied by decreased expression of EMT-related protein E-cadherin and increased expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin. GA can inhibit the malignant behavior of MC cell proliferation and induce its G0/G1 phase arrest, which is achieved by downregulating the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway and thereby inhibiting the EMT process. However, when we incubated with the Wnt pathway activator (Wnt agonist 1), the effect of GA was reversed. Furthermore, analysis of human gastric specimens showed that activation of the Wnt/&#946;-catenin pathway was significantly associated with GPL pathological changes. Meanwhile, GA reversed MNU-induced intestinal metaplasia and partial dysplasia in GPL mice.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Taken together, these results indicate that GA prevents the occurrence and development of GPL by inhibiting the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway and then inhibiting the EMT process, which may become potential candidates for the treatment of GPL.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Previous studies have implicated the deubiquitinase UCHL5 was abnormally expressed in multiple malignancies. However, little was reported about the specific roles of UCHL5 in PAAD. We aimed to identify the biological roles of UCHL5 in PAAD and demonstrate its prognostic significance. Differential analysis revealed that UCHL5 expressed highly in tumors versus normal tissues, like TCGA-PAAD, GSE28735, GSE15471 and collected samples. Patients with high UCHL5 expressions had worse survival outcomes relative to those with low UCHL5 levels. Experimental assays showed that UCHL5 overexpression could significantly enhance cell proliferation, colony formation and self-renewal capacities. UCHL5 could also promote PAAD migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UCHL5 could directly deubiquitinate and stabilize ELK3 proteins. UCHL5 relied on accumulated ELK3 proteins to drive cell growth, stem-like properties and migration abilities. In addition, enrichment analysis based on RNA-seq data implicated that ELK3 mainly correlated with Notch1 signaling and ELK3 could notably elevate ELK3 mRNA levels. UCHL5 could thus promote self-renewal abilities of PAAD and targeting ELK3 could inhibit the stemness features. In contrast, UCHL5 deficiency could suppress PAAD stemness features, and ectopic expression of ELK3 could rescue this effect. Last of all, we utilized the UCHL5 inhibitor, b-AP15, to treat PAAD cells and found that b-AP15 could inhibit the growth of PAAD cells in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our study uncovered the underlying mechanisms of UCHL5/ELK3/Notch1 axis in PAAD progression and stemness maintaince, shedding light on individualized treatment and risk stratification for PAAD patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Herein, we constructed an in vitro 3D organoid model to study the inhibitory effect of nanocarriers on colorectal cancer. And designed hydroxyapatite nanoclusters (c-HAP) mediated by polydopamine (PDA) formed under alkaline conditions (pH 9.0), then used c-HAP to load DOX (c-HAP/DOX) as nanocarrier for improved chemotherapy. In vitro, drug release experiments show that c-HAP/DOX has suitable responsive to pH, can be triggered to the facile release of DOX in a slightly acidic environment (pH 6.0), and maintain specific stability in a neutral pH value (7.4) environment. HAP/DOX showed an excellent antitumor effect in the two-dimensional (2D) cell model and three-dimensional (3D) patient-derived colon cancer organoids (PDCCOs) model. In addition, c-HAP/DOX can release a sufficient amount of DOX to produce cytotoxicity in a slightly acidic environment, entering efficiently into the colorectal cancer cells to form endocytosis and induced apoptosis.

However, the role and mechanism of aberrant autophagy in ovarian cancer remains unclear. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the most important pathway for specific protein degradation. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) have crucial roles in all the stages of tumorigenesis and progression. Herein, we explore the DUBs which contribute to aberrant autophagy in ovarian cancer. TCGA data analysis shows that the autophagy level is suppressed, and the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 is abnormally high expressed in ovarian cancer. We screen and identify that the deubiquitinase PSMD14 negatively regulates autophagy level. Functional studies show that increased PSMD14 expression remarkably enhances ovarian cancer cells malignancy, whereas knockdown of PSMD14 has the opposite effect. Furthermore, in vivo assays show that knockdown of PSMD14 inhibits the growth, lung and abdominal metastasis of ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, PSMD14 directly interacts with LRPPRC and inhibits its ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting autophagy through LRPPRC/Beclin1-Bcl-2/SQSTM1 signaling pathway. Next, we demonstrate that PSMD14 is upregulated in ovarian cancer and high expression of PSMD14 positively correlates with LRPPRC. Taken together, we clarify the role of autophagy in regulating the ovarian cancer phenotype and provide insights into regulatory mechanism of autophagy in ovarian cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

The mechanisms underlying pain during CIN are starting to be uncovered. Neuroimaging allows the identification of brain circuitry involved in pain processing and modulation and has recently been used to unravel the disruptions of that circuitry by neuropathic pain. The present study evaluates the effects of paclitaxel, a cytostatic drug frequently used in cancer treatment, at the neuronal function in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey (PAG) using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). We also studied the metabolic profile at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus using ex vivo spectroscopy. Wistar male rats were intraperitoneal injected with paclitaxel or vehicle solution (DMSO). The evaluation of mechanical sensitivity using von Frey test at baseline (BL), 21 (T21), 28 (T28), 49 (T49) and 56 days (T56) after CIN induction showed that paclitaxel-injected rats presented mechanical hypersensitivity from T21 until T56 after CIN induction. The evaluation of the locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors using open-field test at T28 and T56 after the first injection of paclitaxel revealed that paclitaxel-injected rats walked higher distance with higher velocity at late point of CIN accompanied with a sustained exhibition of anxiety-like behaviors. Imaging studies performed using MEMRI at T28 and T56 showed that paclitaxel treatment increased the neuronal activation in the hypothalamus and PAG at T56 in comparison with the control group. The analysis of data from ex vivo spectroscopy demonstrated that at T28 paclitaxel-injected rats presented an increase of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in the PFC and an increase of NAA and decrease of lactate (Lac) concentration in the hypothalamus compared to the control group. Furthermore, at T56 the paclitaxel-injected rats presented lower NAA and higher taurine (Tau) levels in the PFC. Together, MEMRI and metabolomic data indicate that CIN is associated with neuroplastic changes in brain areas involved in pain modulation and suggests that other events involving glial cells may be happening.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

However, a critical bottleneck still lies in exploring simple and controllable methods to synthesize noble metal chalcogenides especially PtS for in vivo photo-induced cancer imaging and simultaneous therapy. Herein, we proposed the albumin-templated synthesis of size-controllable platinum (II) sulfide nanodots (PtS-NDs) for multimodal cancer imaging and potent photothermal therapy. PtS-NDs were precisely synthesized with a tunable size ranging from 2.1 nm to 4.5 nm through a thermodynamically controlled growth inside albumin nanocages. PtS-NDs yielded significant near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and outstanding photothermal conversion under NIR laser irradiation, as well as effective resistance to photobleaching, thereby generating remarkable in vivo photoacoustic signals and distinct hyperthermia at tumor site. Moreover, these nanodots possessed efficient cellular uptake and tumor targeting capabilities in a size-dependent manner, thus leading to controllable diagnostic and thermo-therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, PtS-NDs with core diameter of 4.5 nm displayed preferable in vivo photoacoustic and CT imaging with high sensitivity, spatially and anatomically enhanced imaging contrast, together with hyperthermia mediated tumor ablation. Thus, the albumin-templated biomimetic synthesis provided an insightful strategy on fabricating theranostic PtS-NDs for potential clinical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Noble metal chalcogenides especially PtS are of particular importance in the field of precise nanomedicine to improve both accuracy of cancer diagnosis and efficiency of tumor treatment. However, the intensively preclinical investigation of PtS was limited due to the lack of simple and controllable synthetic methods. Here, we report an albumin-templated biomineralization synthesis of platinum (II) sulfide nanodots (PtS-NDs). Specifically, albumin-templated biomineralization of PtS-NDs was induced by the electrostatic interactions between albumin and Pt<sup>2+</sup>, followed by the nucleation and growth inside the albumin nanocages. The resulting PtS-NDs showed good dispersibility and biosafety, as well as size-dependent photophysical properties and biological behaviors. Therefore, albumin-based biomineralization is a promising and safe strategy to facilely fabricate Pt-based chalcogenide for tumor theranostics.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Here, via engineered extracellular matrices, we observed that the development of mature FAs, coupled with a symmetrical pattern of radial fiber bundles, appeared at the right-angle vertices in cells with square shape. While circular cells aligned the transverse fibers parallel to the cell edge, and moved them centripetally in a counter-clockwise direction, symmetrical bundles of radial fibers at the vertices of square cells disrupted the counter-clockwise swirling and bridged the transverse fibers to move centripetally. In square cells, the contractile force, generated by the myosin IIA-enriched transverse fibers, were concentrated and transmitted outwards along the symmetrical bundles of radial fibers, to the extracellular matrix through FAs, and thereby driving FA organization and maturation. The symmetrical radial fiber bundles concentrated the transverse fibers contractility inward to the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. The tauter cytoskeletal network adjusted the nuclear-actomyosin force balance to cause nuclear deformability and to increase nuclear translocation of the transcription co-activator YAP, which in turn modulated the switch in MSC commitment. Thus, FAs dynamically respond to geometric cues and remodel actin cytoskeletal network to re-distribute intracelluar tension towards the cell nucleus, and thereby controlling YAP mechanotransduction signaling in regulating MSC fate decision. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We decipher how cellular mechanics is self-organized depending on extracellular geometric features to correlate with mesenchymal stromal cell lineage commitment. In response to geometry constrains on cell morphology, symmetrical radial fiber bundles are assembled and clustered depending on the maturation state of focal adhesions and bridge with the transverse fibers, and thereby establishing the dynamic cytoskeletal network. Contractile force, generated by the myosin-IIA-enriched transverse fibers, is transmitted and dynamically drives the retrograde movement of the actin cytoskeletal network, which appropriately adjusts the nuclear-actomyosin force balance and deforms the cell nucleus for YAP mechano-transduction signaling in regulating mesenchymal stromal cell fate decision.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Since one of the mechanisms of muscle wasting in cachexia is defective muscle regeneration due to impaired myogenic differentiation, we examined the effect of IL11 on the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Treatment of C2C12 cells with recombinant mouse IL11 resulted in decreased myotube formation. In addition, IL11 treatment reduced the protein and mRNA levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC), a marker of myogenic differentiation. Moreover, the levels of myogenic regulatory factors including myogenin and Mrf4 were significantly reduced by IL11 treatment. IL11 treatment increased the number of BrdU-positive cells and the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, while the levels of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were reduced by IL11 treatment in differentiating C2C12 cells, suggesting that IL11 interferes with cell cycle exit during the early stages of myogenic differentiation. Consistent with this, IL11 treatment at the late stage of differentiation did not affect myotube formation and MHC expression. IL11 treatment resulted in an activation of ERK, STAT3, and AKT in differentiating C2C12 cells. However, only ERK inhibitors including PD98059 and U0126 were able to ameliorate the suppressive effect of IL11 on the expression of MHC and myogenin. Additionally, pretreatment with PD98059 and U0126 resulted in improved myotube formation and reduced BrdU staining in IL11-treated cells. Together, our results suggest that IL11 inhibits myogenic differentiation through delayed cell cycle exit in an ERK-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate an inhibitory role of IL11 in myogenic differentiation and identifies the previously unrecognized role of IL11 as a possible mediator of CAC.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>The underlying mechanisms by which cellular metabolism affects cervical cancer cell radiosensitivity remain poorly understood. Here, we found that loss of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1 (HMGCS1), a key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, sensitizes the cervical cancer cells to radiation. We observed a compartmentalized cellular distribution of HMGCS1 in nuclei, cytosol, and mitochondria of cervical cancer cells and found that cytosolic HMGCS1 and mitochondrial HMGCS1 contribute together to the regulation of radiosensitivity. Mechanistically, we show that cytosolic HMGCS1 regulates radiosensitivity via manipulating the cholesterol metabolism, while mitochondrial HMGCS1 controls mitochondrial gene expression, thereby sustaining the mitochondrial function of cervical cancer cells. Together, our study identifies HMGCS1 as a novel regulator of radiosensitivty in cervical cancer cells, providing a molecular link between altered cholesterol metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and radiosensitivity. Thus, targeting HMGCS1 may improve the therapeutic outcome of cervical cancer radiotherapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Estradiol mimicking properties and association studies suggest phthalates may contribute to breast cancer (BC). We performed an in-silico analysis and functional studies to understand the association between phthalate exposure and BC progression. Search for phthalate-responsive genes using the comparative toxicogenomics database identified 20 genes as commonly altered in response to multiple phthalates exposure. Of the 20 genes, 12 were significantly differentially expressed between normal and BC samples. In BC samples, 9 out of 20 genes showed a negative correlation between promoter methylation and its expression. AHR, BAX, BCL2, CAT, ESR2, IL6, and PTGS2 expression differed significantly between metastatic and non-metastatic BC samples. Gene set enrichment analysis identified metabolism, ATP-binding cassette transporters, insulin signaling, and type II diabetes as highly enriched pathways. The diagnostic assessment based on 20 genes expression suggested a sensitivity and a specificity &gt;0.91. The aberrantly expressed phthalate interactive gene influenced the overall survival of BC patients. Drug-gene interaction analysis identified 14 genes and 523 candidate drugs, including 19&#8239;BCE treatment-approved drugs. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthlate (DEHP) exposure increased the growth, proliferation, and migration of MCF7 and MDAMB231 cells in-vitro. DEHP exposure induced morphological changes, actin cytoskeletal remodeling, increased ROS content, reduced basal level lipid peroxidation, and induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present approach can help explore the potentially damaging effects of environmental agents on cancer risk and understand the underlined pathways and molecular mechanisms.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Ubiquitination is a dynamic process that is coordinately regulated by E3 ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs), which have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets. HIF expression and transcriptional activity are usually increased in tumors, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are upregulated in tumors and have multiple effects on HIF signaling and the ubiquitin system. A growing body of evidence has shown that multiple E3 ligases and UBDs function synergistically to control the expression and activity of HIF, thereby allowing cancer cells to cope with the hypoxic microenvironment. Conversely, several E3 ligases and DUBs are regulated by hypoxia and/or HIF signaling. Hypoxia also induces ROS production, which in turn modulates the stability or activity of HIF, E3 ligases, and DUBs. Understanding the complex networks between E3 ligase, DUBS, ROS, and HIF will provide insights into the fundamental mechanism of the cellular response to hypoxia and help identify novel molecular targets for cancer treatment. We review the current knowledge on the comprehensive relationship between E3 ligase, DUBs, ROS, and HIF signaling, with a particular focus on the use of E3 ligase or DUB inhibitors in cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Finally, using COVID-19 as an example of an external system shock, we compared hospitals\\' SPI to their planned surgical volume ratio (SVR; ie, operations for which the decision for surgery was made before hospital admission), calculated as the ratio of the observed surgical volume over a 1-month assessment period between June 6 and Aug 5, 2021, against the expected surgical volume based on hospital administrative data from the same period in 2019 (ie, a pre-pandemic baseline). A linear mixed-effects regression model was used to determine the effect of increasing SPI score.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"FINDINGS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">In the first phase, from a longlist of 103 candidate indicators, 23 were prioritised as core indicators of elective surgical system preparedness by 69 clinicians (23 [33%] women; 46 [67%] men; 41 from HICs, 22 from MICs, and six from LICs) from 32 countries. The multidomain SPI included 11 indicators on facilities and consumables, two on staffing, two on prioritisation, and eight on systems.

Relevant data from the top 20 international pharmaceutical companies from 2011 to 2021 were systematically collected from the Trialtrove and Pharmaprojects databases. Among the 8260 trials for 954 new anticancer drugs identified, China was involved in 8&#183;8% of the trials and with 20&#183;4% of the drugs being trialled. These participation rates are significantly lower than those for South Korea (14&#183;5% of trials and 36&#183;3% of drugs), Japan (16&#183;1% of trials and 38&#183;7% of drugs), the EU (40&#183;6% of trials and 67&#183;7% of drugs), and the USA (65&#183;7% of trials and 91&#183;2% of drugs; p&lt;0&#183;0001 for all). Similar results were found for the synchronous participation rate, defined as the proportion of drugs or trials at the highest development stage internationally, for the 803 tested drugs, which ranged from 9&#183;0% in China to 87&#183;7% in the USA. China's participation rate in early phase trials (4&#183;4%) and in synchronous trials (5&#183;4%) was even lower, in stark contrast to that of the USA (66&#183;1% for early phase trials and 89&#183;1% for synchronous trials). The fastest growing annual rate of participation in trials was observed in China (15&#183;7%), followed by South Korea (8&#183;2%) and Japan (6&#183;8%); no change was detected in the USA or the EU. This Policy Review shows that Chinese participation in the clinical development of innovative cancer drugs by international pharmaceutical companies has increased over the past decade, but an obvious gap persists in comparison with the USA, the EU, Japan, and South Korea, especially in its synchronous participation and early participation rates.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

All ten jurisdictions had structures in place to oversee or deliver cancer control policies and had published at least one major cancer plan. Few cancer plans had explicit budgets for implementation or mandated external evaluation. Cancer policy consistency was positively correlated with improvements in survival over time for six of the seven cancer sites. Jurisdictions that scored the highest on policy consistency had large improvements in survival for most sites. Our analysis provides an important first step to systematically capture and evaluate what are inherently complex policy processes.

Although bilateral neck exploration is traditionally the standard method for surgery, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP), or focused parathyroidectomy, has been widely accepted with comparable curative outcomes. For successful MIP, accurate preoperative localization of parathyroid lesions is essential. However, no consensus exists on the optimal approach for localization. Currently, ultrasonography and technetium-99m-sestamibi-single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography are widely accepted in most cases. However, exact localization cannot always be achieved, especially in cases with multiglandular disease, ectopic glands, recurrent disease, and normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, new modalities for preoperative localization have been developed and evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography and parathyroid venous sampling have demonstrated improvements in sensitivity and accuracy. Both anatomical and functional information can be obtained by combining these methods. As each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, the localization study should be deliberately chosen based on each patient's clinical profile, costs, radiation exposure, and the availability of experienced experts. In this review, we summarize various methods for the localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissues in primary hyperparathyroidism.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Yet, how this occurs and whether transfer of oxidative equivalents to the mitochondrion is required remain unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of the ETC drives reversal of the mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (GOT2) as well as malate and succinate dehydrogenases (MDH2 and SDH) to transfer oxidative NAD<sup>+</sup> equivalents into the mitochondrion. This supports the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent activity of the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and thereby enables anaplerosis-the entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle and connected biosynthetic pathways. Thus, under impaired ETC function, the cytosolic redox state is communicated into the mitochondrion and acts as a rheostat to support GDH activity and cell viability.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

OTS964 is notable as it displays a measure of specificity for CDK11 in cells. To understand the basis for OTS964's specificity for CDK11, we solved a 2.6&#160;&#197; crystal structure of the CDK11 kinase domain bound to OTS964. Despite the absence of cyclin, CDK11 adopts an active-like conformation when bound to OTS964.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that some immune regulatory molecules, such as LGALS9 (coding Galectin-9) and CD48, were expressed in most canine tumors, but other molecules, such as CD274 (coding PD-L1), IL4I1, PVR, TNFSF18, ICOSLG, and TNFSF4, were rarely expressed.

In this context, dealing with MIPs synthesis for bio-macromolecules detection/extraction, one of the critical steps in ensuring effective binding affinity for the parent molecule is the selection of suitable epitopes for pCAs imprinting. To address this challenge, here we investigated the ability of lysine (K) residues to trigger the epitope imprinting process into a polynorepinephrine (PNE) matrix. To this aim, we first designed a set of model epitopes composed of three K and six alanine (A) residues to investigate the influence of each 'KA' combination on the imprinting process and the resulting binding performance by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Only the case of three flanking K residues in N-terminus arose as an excellent trigger for epitope imprinting. The efficacy of the 3K-tag strategy was then evaluated on two peptide templates belonging to soluble programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1), which is of great interest as a cancer biomarker in liquid biopsies. These templates were selected due to their negligible natural ability to be imprinted into the PNE matrix and were modified with 3K-tags, in N-, C-, and N/C- positions, respectively. The SPR sensor developed by exploiting the N-3K tag strategy allowed us to achieve excellent sensitivity (0.31&#160;&#177;&#160;0.04&#160;ng&#160;mL<sup>-1</sup>) and repeatability (<sub>av</sub>CV%&#160;=&#160;4.5) in human serum samples. This strategy opens new insights both for epitopes' design for pCAs-based mimetics and as triggering tags when native epitopes display negligible imprinting capabilities.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) as an alternative prostate tumor-specificity biomarker could be used to increase the specificity of PCa diagnosis, however, it usually required sophisticated operation and expensive equipment for routine detection. Herein, we constructed an early detection platform for prostate cancer with reverse transcriptase-recombinase aided amplification (RT-RAA) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 based nucleic acid test strip. The amplicons of PCA3 and kallikrein related peptidase 3 (KLK3) gene, which amplified simultaneously by single-amplification unit of RT-RAA were specifically recognized by Cas9-sgRNA and visual on the nucleic acid test strip by naked eyes without instruments. Simultaneously detection of PCA3 and KLK3 gene could improve specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis but avoid mutual interference. In addition, the platform presented a detection limit of 500&#160;fg/&#956;L and 50&#160;fg/&#956;L in PCA3 and KLK3 gene, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis result of signal ratio of PCA3 to KLK3 gene of urine and peripheral blood specimens from 32 men with suspected prostate cancer on test strips illustrated that the area under the curve values of urine and peripheral blood specimens were 0.998 and 1.0 respectively. In summary, our study highlighted a facile strategy to design an accurate prostate cancer gene detection platform which had the potential to conduct prostate cancer early detection in the resource-limited or other point-of-care testing (POCT) environments.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Even though we have learned much about the contribution of lymphocytes to CNS pathologies, a better understanding of differential roles of tissue-resident and -invading phagocytes is slowly emerging. In this perspective, we propose that in CNS neuroinflammatory diseases, tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) contribute to the clearing of debris and resolution of inflammation, whereas blood-borne phagocytes are drivers of immunopathology.

The symptoms of psoriasis are unpredictable, and there are several external factors and associated comorbidities including psoriatic arthritis, renal failure, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, mental disorders, cancer and a higher risk of death due to the systemic inflammation associated with the condition. In 2014, the WHA resolution identified that psoriasis is a severe non-communicable condition that affects both men and women.

By testing for resistance to different antibiotic classes, we discovered that the majority of clinical bacteria are multidrug-resistant. These clinical multidrug-resistant species have antibiotic resistance genes on their plasmids that can be horizontally transferred to various antibiotic susceptible environmental bacterial species, resulting in antibiotic-resistant transconjugates. Furthermore, we discovered that the presence of an optimal concentration of antibiotics or heavy metal (arsenic) facilitates horizontal gene transfer through the formation of transconjugants. Notably, the addition of a conjugation inhibitor (2-hexadecynoic acid, a synthetic fatty acid) completely blocked the formation of antibiotic or arsenic-induced transconjugants. We discovered a high level of arsenic in water from the Shukratal region, Uttarakhand, India, which corresponded to a high serum level of arsenic in clinically infected individuals from the Shukratal region compared to other locations in Uttarakhand. Importantly, bacterial strains isolated from infected people who drink water from the Shukratal region with high arsenic levels were found to be more antibiotic-resistant than strains isolated from other sites. We discovered that bacterial strains isolated from individuals with high serum arsenic levels are significantly more resistant to antibiotics than individuals with low serum arsenic levels within the Shurkratal. This research sheds light on imminent threats to global health in which improper clinical, industrial, and other waste disposal, increased antibiotic concentrations in the environment, and increased human interference can easily transform commensal and pathogenic bacteria found in environmental niches into life-threatening multidrug-resistant superbugs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The conception of gene-activated titanium implants is based on \"gene-activated matrix\" (GAM), which means scaffolds using non-viral vectors for in situ gene delivery to achieve a long-term and efficient transfection of target cells.

However, how does the interplay between metabolic dysfunction caused by MS and its individual components affect CC microenvironment and prognosis remains unexplored. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are fundamental processes for tumor progression and dissemination, ensuring oxygen and nutrient delivery and supporting one of the most important pathways of tumor dissemination, contributing to metastasis. Thus, our aim was to evaluate whether the expression of molecular biomarkers involved in angiogenic and lymphangiogenic processes influenced CC clinicopathological features and prognosis in patients with MS. Clinical and pathological data of 300 patients submitted to CC surgical resection at a single tertiary hospital were retrospectively retrieved from hospital records. Tumor tissue microarrays of archived paraffin-embedded blocks were used to assess CD31, VEGF-A and D2-40 tissue expression by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of stained area was quantified by computerized morphometric analysis. No association between tissue expression of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis biomarkers and tumor clinical and pathological characteristics was found. However, in subgroup analysis of patients with MS, dysglycemia was associated with lower D2-40 expression (p&#160;=&#160;0.007) and high waist-circumference was associated with higher D2-40 (p&#160;=&#160;0.0029) and VEGF-A expression (p&#160;=&#160;0.026). In an adjusted Cox proportional hazard model CD31 expression was significantly associated with greater disease-free survival (HR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.41-0.95, p&#160;=&#160;0.028). No association was found between D2-40 and VEGF-A expression and CC prognosis. Our data reinforces previous reports that suggest the potential use of CD31 as a CC prognostic biomarker. Additionally, our data further supports the evidence for an interplay between metabolic dysfunction, tumor microenvironment, and vascularization pathways.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Authors.

Furthermore, cholesterol synthesis is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), and certain glucose transporters (GLUTs) and Ras-related protein Rab11 (Rab11) small GTPase family members (Rab11s) may contribute to the process. The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to analyze the relationship between prognosis and GLUT gene expressions. To investigate the regulatory effect of Rab11s and SREBP2 on GLUTs during tumor progression, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were performed on glioma tissues and the T98G GBM cell line. Cell viability and migration were assessed by performing MTT and wound healing assays, respectively. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to predict the sterol regulatory elements in the promoter regions of the target genes. The results demonstrated that high SREBP2, GLUT1 and GLUT6 expression was associated with poor survival of patients with GBM. ScRNA-seq distinguished glioblastoma cells by EGFR and indicated the related lipid metabolism signaling pathways. Moreover, the results indicated that GLUT1 and GLUT6 were regulated by SREBP2 and Rab11s. Rab11s and SREBP2 also contributed to T98G cell viability and migration. Additionally, the results indicated that Rab11s, GLUT1 and GLUT6 were transcriptionally regulated by SREBP2. Therefore, the present study suggested that the SREBP2/Rab11/GLUT network promoted T98G cell growth, thus, identifying potential therapeutic targets for GBM.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

The dysfunction of SCNN1G has been widely studied in kidney-related diseases and chronic heart failure. However, its role in cancer remains unclear. Here, we found that SCNN1G was aberrantly downregulated in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) tissues, which showed an efficifent diagnostic value according to the ROC curve analysis. The lower expression of SCNN1G was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis and a worse outcome of HNSCC patients. Ectopic overexpressing SCNN1G inhibited the invasive and migratory abilities of HNSCC cells, while knocking down SCNN1G showed an opposite effect. A positive correlation between SCNN1G and CDH1 expression was observed, which suggested that SCNN1G might impede HNSCC metastasis via strengthing cell-cell adherin. In addition, RAS signaling and ion channel transport signaling were enriched by SCNN1G in HNSCC using GSEA analysis, indicating that these signaling pathways might be the underlying mechanisms for SCNN1G as well. In addition, six sorts of immune infiltrate subtype cells were associated with SCNN1G expression. Our findings support that SCNN1G inactivation contributes to the metastasis of HNSCC. SCNN1G could serves as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker for HNSCC.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Nine additional proteins that can be targeted to selectively kill BRCA-deficient cancer cells have been identified.

Increasing evidence has shown the association between microRNA (miRNA) phenotype and AML therapeutic outcomes, emphasizing the need for novel techniques for convenient, sensitive, and efficient miRNA profiling in clinical practices. Here, we describe a nanoneedle-based discrete single-cell microRNA profiling technique for multiplexed phenotyping of AML heterogeneity without the requirement of sequencing or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In virtue of a biochip-based and non-destructive nature of the assay, the expression of nine miRNAs in large number of living AML cells can be simultaneously analyzed with discrete single-cell level information, thus providing a proof-of-concept demonstration of an AML subtype classifier based on the multidimensional miRNA data. We showed successful analysis of subtype-specific cellular composition with over 90% accuracy and identified drug-responsive leukemia subpopulations among a mixed suspension of cells modeling different AML subtypes. The adoption of machine learning algorithms for processing the large-scale nanoneedle-based miRNA data shows the potential for powerful prediction capability in clinical applications to assist therapeutic decisions.

Levels of circ_0015756, microRNA (miR)-&#160;145-5p and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) were detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot or immunohistochemistry assays. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined using cell counting kit-8, 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine (Edu) incorporation, flow cytometry, transwell and Western blot assays. The binding interaction between miR-145-5p and circ_0015756 or PSAT1 was confirmed by bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Tumor formation assay in nude mice was performed to determine the tumor growth in vivo. Circ_0015756 was highly expressed in OC tissues and cells. Knockdown of circ_0015756 suppressed cancer cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as impeded tumor growth in vivo. In a mechanical study, circ_0015756 directly bound to miR-145-5p, and inhibition of miR-145-5p reversed the effects of circ_0015756 knockdown on OC cells. Moreover, miR-145-5p directly targeted PSAT1, and miR-145-5p weakened OC cell growth, migration and invasion via targeting PSAT1. Importantly, further studies confirmed that circ_0015756 could indirectly regulate PSAT1 expression via sponging miR-145-5p.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Cancer region detection (CRD) and subtyping are two fundamental tasks in digital pathology image analysis. The development of data-driven models for CRD and subtyping on whole-slide images&#160;(WSIs) would mitigate the burden of pathologists and improve their accuracy in diagnosis. However, the existing models are facing two major limitations. Firstly, they typically require large-scale datasets with precise annotations, which contradicts with the original intention of reducing labor effort. Secondly, for the subtyping task, the non-cancerous regions are treated as the same as cancerous regions within a WSI, which confuses a subtyping model in its training process. To tackle the latter limitation, the previous research proposed to perform CRD first for ruling out the non-cancerous region, then train a subtyping model based on the remaining cancerous patches. However, separately training ignores the interaction of these two tasks, also leads to propagating the error of the CRD task to the subtyping task. To address these issues and concurrently improve the performance on both CRD and subtyping tasks, we propose a semi-supervised multi-task learning&#160;(MTL) framework for cancer classification. Our framework consists of a backbone feature extractor, two task-specific classifiers, and a weight control mechanism. The backbone feature extractor is shared by two task-specific classifiers, such that the interaction of CRD and subtyping tasks can be captured. The weight control mechanism preserves the sequential relationship of these two tasks and guarantees the error back-propagation from the subtyping task to the CRD task under the MTL framework. We train the overall framework in a semi-supervised setting, where datasets only involve small quantities of annotations produced by our minimal point-based&#160;(min-point) annotation strategy. Extensive experiments on four large datasets with different cancer types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both accuracy and generalization.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The emotional and physical health toll of providing treatment may contribute to shortages. This community-initiated qualitative study aimed to identify conditions that affect provider health and turnover in residential addiction treatment from a Total Worker Health&#174; perspective. Providers (direct service, supervisors, leaders) working in nonprofit residential treatment facilities in Massachusetts were recruited by role and geography to participate in interviews and focus groups. NVivo12 facilitated coding and analysis. 25% of transcripts were double coded to assess interrater reliability and coding consistency (mean Kappa&#160;=&#160;0.82). Providers (N&#160;=&#160;49) participated in 33 interviews and 4 focus groups. Many participants reported personal addiction histories. Analysis revealed how socio-contextual factors originating outside of residential facilities were dominant influences on \"downstream\" working conditions, worker health, staff turnover, and by extension, client care. Four primary socio-contextual themes surfaced:1) Changes in type and potency of substances and client need not reliably accompanied by shifts in treatment practices; 2) challenges balancing state requirements and state-provided resources; 3) influence of structural discrimination and addiction stigma on pay and professional advancement; and 4) geographic location of facilities shape work and quality of life. Results were used to develop a conceptual model for residential addiction treatment to illustrate pathways by which ecological factors interact to affect provider health and turnover. Findings indicate that protecting health and wellbeing of providers-many of whom are in addiction recovery themselves- is integral to improving addiction treatment. From this workforce\\'s perspective, recent changes in socio-contextual factors have intensified already challenging working conditions (job demands, pay, advancement), negatively impacting worker health, turnover, and client care. Any interventions to improve treatment outcomes or working conditions in nonprofit addiction facilities must consider larger socio-contextual factors influencing these organizations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The miR-17-92 cluster is one of the most widely studied miRNA clusters, which was initially reported as an oncogene, but was later reported to exhibit tumour suppressive effects in some human cancers. This review summarizes the recent progress and context-dependant role of this cluster in various cancers. We summarize the known mechanisms which regulate miR-17-92 expression and molecular pathways that are in turn controlled by it. We discuss examples where it acts as an oncogene or a tumour suppressor along with key targets affecting hallmarks of cancer. We discuss how cellular contexts regulate the biological effects of miR-17-92. The plausible mechanisms of its paradoxical roles are explained, and mechanisms are described that may contribute to cell fate regulation by miR-17-92. Further, we discuss recently developed strategies to target miR-17-92 cluster in human cancers.

Biosensors are potential tools for the rapid detection and quantification of mycotoxins with high sensitivity and selectivity. Nanoliposomes (NLs) are vesicular carriers formed by self-assembling phospholipids that surround the aqueous cores. Utilizing their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high carrying capacity, researchers have employed NLs in biosensors for monitoring various targets in biological and food samples. The NLs are used for surface modification, signal marker delivery, and detection of toxins, bacteria, pesticides, and diseases. Here, we review marker-entrapped NLs used in the development of NL-based biosensors for mycotoxins. These biosensors are sensitive, selective, portable, and cost-effective analytical tools, and the resulting signal can be produced and/or amplified with or without destroying the NLs. In addition, this review emphasizes the benefits of the immunoliposome method in comparison with traditional detection approaches.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>There is overwhelming evidence that presence of cancer alters cellular metabolic processes, and these changes are manifested in emitted volatile organic compound (VOC) compositions of cancer cells. Here, we take a novel forward engineering approach by developing an insect olfactory neural circuit-based VOC sensor for cancer detection. We obtained oral cancer cell culture VOC-evoked extracellular neural responses from in vivo insect (locust) antennal lobe neurons. We employed biological neural computations of the antennal lobe circuitry for generating spatiotemporal neuronal response templates corresponding to each cell culture VOC mixture, and employed these neuronal templates to distinguish oral cancer cell lines (SAS, Ca9-22, and HSC-3) vs. a non-cancer cell line (HaCaT). Our results demonstrate that three different human oral cancers can be robustly distinguished from each other and from a non-cancer oral cell line. By using high-dimensional population neuronal response analysis and leave-one-trial-out methodology, our approach yielded high classification success for each cell line tested. Our analyses achieved 76-100% success in identifying cell lines by using the population neural response (n&#160;=&#160;194) collected for the entire duration of the cell culture study. We also demonstrate this cancer detection technique can distinguish between different types of oral cancers and non-cancer at different time-matched points of growth. This brain-based cancer detection approach is fast as it can differentiate between VOC mixtures within 250&#160;ms of stimulus onset. Our brain-based cancer detection system comprises a novel VOC sensing methodology that incorporates entire biological chemosensory arrays, biological signal transduction, and neuronal computations in a form of a forward-engineered technology for cancer VOC detection.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The immune system including the innate and adaptive immune system fights against this tumor. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in this way by recognizing tumor antigens and activating specific types of T cells. These cells are derived from monocytes that are induced by inflammatory factors secreted by different cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). There are different types of DCs, including monocyte-derived DCs (moDC), plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), conventional DCs type 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2), and Langerhans cells. DCs connect the innate and the adaptive part of the immune system and have an important role in anti-tumor immunity. There are some vaccines that involve specific types of DCs, which can be used to prevent neuroblastoma. Also, we can use the combination of inflammatory factors and DCs as a substitute for chemotherapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

Crosstalk among components of this cellular ecosystem can transform non-malignant cells and promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Evidence is accumulating that the transcription factor STAT2, a downstream effector of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, can either inhibit or promote tumorigenesis depending on the unique environment presented by each type of cancer. STAT2 has long been associated with the canonical JAK/STAT pathway involved in various biological processes including reshaping of the tumor microenvironment and in antitumor immunity. This dichotomous tendency of STAT2 to both inhibit and worsen tumor formation makes the protein a curious, and yet relatively ill-defined player in many cancer pathways involving IFN-I. In this review, we discuss the role of STAT2 in contributing to either a tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic microenvironment as well as chemoresistance.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 The Author(s).

The structure of C1 and C2 was confirmed by elemental analysis, FTIR, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Complex C1 crystallizes as binuclear where two Cu (II) ions are bridged by four acetate ligands while C2 is a mononuclear complex with twisted octahedral geometry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that electronic transitions originate from metal-ligand charge transfer and d-d transitions of metal ions. According to the results of UV-Vis and fluorescence titrations, C1 and C2 intercalate with DNA with the binding constants of 6.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;M<sup>-1</sup> and 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10<sup>5</sup>&#160;M<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain - United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1-49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of &lt;1 month), subacute (duration of 1-3 months), and chronic (duration of &gt;3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Cancer patients, their families and the general public accessing the information are often in challenging, stressful, situations, wanting to access accurate information as efficiently as possible. In addition, there is seldom any comprehensive information specifically on radiotherapy, despite the large number of cancer patients in senior ages, to go through the treatment process. Therefore, having \"someone\" with professional knowledge who can \"listen\" to them, provide the medical information with good will and encouragement would help patients and families struggling with critical illness, in particular during the lingering pandemic.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"OBJECTIVE\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">The goal of this work is to create a novel virtual assistant, a chatbot that can explain the radiation treatment process to stakeholders comprehensively and accurately, in the absence of any similar software. This virtual assistant was created using the IBM WATSON assistant with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) features. The chatbot or Bot was incorporated into a resource that can be easily accessed by the general public.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The radiation treatment process in a cancer hospital/centre was described by the radiotherapy process: (1) patient diagnosis, consultation and prescription, (2) patient positioning, immobilization and simulation, (3) 3D imaging for treatment planning, (4) target and organ contouring, (5) radiation treatment planning, (6) patient setup and plan verification, and (7) treatment delivery. The Bot was created using IBM WATSON assistant. The natural language processing (NLP) feature in the WATSON platform allowed the Bot to flow through a given conversation structure and recognize how the user responds based on recognition of similar given examples, referred to as \"intents\" during development. The Bot therefore can be trained from the responses received, by recognizing similar responses from the user and analysed by the WATSON NLP.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">The Bot is hosted on a website by the WATSON application programming interface (API). It is capable of guiding the user through the conversation structure and can respond to simple questions and provide resources for requests for information that was not directly programmed into the Bot. The Bot was tested by potential users and the overall averages of the identified metrics are excellent. The Bot can also acquire users\\' feedbacks for further improvements in the routine update.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">An AI-assisted chatbot was created for the knowledge transfer of radiation treatment process to the cancer patients, their families and general public.

This paper discusses challenges faced in the implementation of the NOURISH-T+ trial so far (December 2019-March 2022) and describes adaptations made as a result of these disruptions in the areas of recruitment, data collection, and overall engagement. This reflection is based on a multisite cluster-RCT that aims to examine whether an intervention targeting parents as agents of change to promote healthy eating and physical activity in pediatric cancer survivors, NOURISH-T+ (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role modeling to Improve Support and Health for Healthy Transitions), reduces body mass and improves health behaviors compared to Brief NOURISH-T (Enhanced Usual Care/EUC). The COVID-19 pandemic has created and exacerbated challenges for our trial related to participant recruitment and engagement, technology access and literacy, and data collection and management, as well as COVID-related challenges (e.g., Zoom fatigue). Strategies used to address these challenges might prove helpful in future virtual or hybrid RCTs, including developing trust and rapport with participants, providing support through multiple routes of dissemination, and using data management applications (e.g., REDCap&#8482;) for automation and project management. Extra efforts to build families' trust and rapport, offering multiple routes of support, and automating as many tasks as possible are critical to ensuring the continuation of high-quality clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; Society of Behavioral Medicine 2022.

This is because measurement systems designed for adult cancers do not apply to children\\'s cancers and cancer registries often hold limited information on paediatric tumour stage and the data sources used to define it.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"AIMS\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">The BENCHISTA project aims to test the application of the international consensus \"Toronto Staging Guidelines\" (TG) for paediatric tumours by European and non-European PBCRs for six common paediatric solid tumours so that reliable comparisons of stage at diagnosis and survival rates by stage can be made to understand any differences. A secondary aim is to test the data availability and completeness of collection of several \\'Toronto\\' consensus non-stage prognostic factors, treatment types given, occurrence of relapse/progression and cause of death as a descriptive feasibility study.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">PBCRs will use their permitted data access channels to apply the Toronto staging guidelines to all incident cases of six solid childhood cancers (medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewings sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour) diagnosed in a consecutive three-year period within 2014-2017 in their population. Each registry will provide a de-identified patient-level dataset including tumour stage at diagnosis, with only the contributing registry holding the information that would be needed to re-identify the patients. Where available to the registry, patient-level data on \\'Toronto\\' non-stage prognostic factors, treatments given and clinical outcomes (relapse/progression/cause of death) will be included. More than 60 PBCRs have been involved in defining the patient-level dataset items and intend to participate by contributing their population-level data. Tumour-specific on-line training workshops with clinical experts are available to cancer registry staff to assist them in applying the Toronto staging guidelines in a consistent manner. There is also a project-specific help desk for discussion of difficult cases and promotion of the CanStaging online tools, developed through the International Association of Cancer Registries, to further ensure standardisation of data collection. Country-specific stage distribution and observed survival by stage at diagnosis will be calculated for each tumour type to compare survival between countries or large geographical regions.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"DISCUSSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">This study will be promote and enhance the collection of standardized staging data for childhood cancer by European and non-European population-based cancer registries. Therefore, this project can be seen as a feasibility project of widespread use of Toronto Staging at a population-level by cancer registries, specifying the data sources used and testing how well standardized the processes can be. Variation in tumour stage distribution could be due to real differences, to different diagnostic practices between countries and/or to variability in how cancer registries assign Toronto stage. This work also aims to strengthen working relationships between cancer registries, clinical services and cancer-specific clinical study groups, which is important for improving patient outcomes and stimulating research.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Host genetics is a key determinant of COVID-19 outcomes. Previously, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative genome-wide association study used common variants to identify multiple loci associated with COVID-19 outcomes. However, variants with the largest impact on COVID-19 outcomes are expected to be rare in the population. Hence, studying rare variants may provide additional insights into disease susceptibility and pathogenesis, thereby informing therapeutics development. Here, we combined whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing from 21 cohorts across 12 countries and performed rare variant exome-wide burden analyses for COVID-19 outcomes. In an analysis of 5,085 severe disease cases and 571,737 controls, we observed that carrying a rare deleterious variant in the SARS-CoV-2 sensor toll-like receptor TLR7 (on chromosome X) was associated with a 5.3-fold increase in severe disease (95% CI: 2.75-10.05, p = 5.41x10-7). This association was consistent across sexes. These results further support TLR7 as a genetic determinant of severe disease and suggest that larger studies on rare variants influencing COVID-19 outcomes could provide additional insights.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

However, owing to the extremely low levels of some tumor-associated proteins in individual cells, the absolute quantification of such tumor-associated proteins in a single cell remains a challenge. Herein, an intracellular multicomponent synchronous DNA-walking strategy is proposed for the simultaneous quantification of multiple tumor-associated proteins in a single cell. In this strategy, a nanoprobe based on a DNA walker was designed for the simultaneous signal amplification of nucleolin (NCL) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in a single cell. NCL and TK1 in single cells were simultaneously detected on a microchip platform with detection limits of 1.0 and 0.8 pM, respectively. The results obtained from 20 liver cancer cells (HepG2) and 20 normal hepatocytes (HL-7702) indicated that NCL and TK1 were overexpressed in liver cancer cells. However, the levels of NCL and TK1 in normal hepatocytes are only about one-tenth to one-sixth of those in hepatic carcinoma. Using different nucleic acid aptamers, the proposed strategy can be applied for the analysis of other single-cell proteins and in the early diagnosis of cancer.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The cancerous cells and their corresponding normal cells are both considered to be liquid cells each with their unique refractive index (RI). Normally these cells are found in liquid form in the suitable media (food) required to live the cancerous/normal cell lines. Also in our detection case, liquid samples are easy to pump into the sensing channel of the proposed PCF by employing either pressure or capillary forces.The proposed PCF sensor works on the SPR principle, with the Au coating serving as the plasmonic material. This sensor is investigated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software computational tool that is based on the full-vector finite element method (FEM). A TiO<sub>2</sub> coating has been applied to enhance adhesion between the Au layer and the PCF surface. Above the Au coating, cancerous cells samples are filled into the PCF. When the core mode of the PCF is coupled with the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode under the specific resonance circumstances, SPR will occur on the interface of the gold-sample cell, and in the core mode, the loss peak is observed at the resonance wavelength. Cancerous cells samples have a distinct loss peak than normal cells samples therefore the cancerous cells can be diagnosed by measuring the shift in resonance wavelength corresponding to the loss peak of cancerous and their normal cells samples. The proposed sensor may identify various cancerous cells such as MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat for the diagnosis of breast cancer type-1, breast cancer type-2, adrenal glands, cervical, and blood cancer respectively. The computed wavelengths sensitivities of the proposed PCF are 9428.57 nm/RIU, 10714.28 nm/RIU, 7571.43 nm/RIU, 5500 nm/RIU, and 6000 nm/RIU for the MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat cancerous cells, respectively. However, for various cancerous cells, the maximum amplitude sensitivity varies from -1387 RIU<sup>-1</sup> to -1599 RIU<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the sensor resolution ranges between 0.93&#215;10<sup>-5</sup> RIU and 1.82&#215;10<sup>-5</sup> RIU with a 0.024 maximum detection limit. Because of its improved sensing capability, the presented SPR refractometric sensor is appropriate for the early detection of cancerous cells.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Multi-phase CT is widely adopted for the di- agnosis of kidney cancer due to the complementary in- formation among phases. However, the complete set of multi-phase CT is often not available in practical clinical applications. In recent years, there have been some studies to generate the missing modality image from the available data. Nevertheless, the generated images are not guaran- teed to be effective for the diagnosis task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for kidney cancer diagnosis with incomplete multi-phase CT, which simultaneously re- covers missing CT images and classifies cancer subtypes using the completed set of images. The advantage of our framework is that it encourages a synthesis model to ex- plicitly learn to generate missing CT phases that are helpful for classifying cancer subtypes. We further incorporate lesion segmentation network into our framework to exploit lesion-level features for effective cancer classification in the whole CT volumes. The proposed framework is based on fully 3D convolutional neural networks to jointly optimize both synthesis and classification of 3D CT volumes. Exten- sive experiments on both in-house and external datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for the diagnosis with incomplete data compared with state-of-the- art baselines. In particular, cancer subtype classification using the completed CT data by our method achieves higher performance than the classification using the given incomplete data.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

However, despite high initial response rates, most patients eventually relapse. The outcomes of patients with disease recurrence after BCMA-directed CAR T have not been comprehensively studied and such an analysis would help define optimal treatment strategies. We analyzed the salvage treatments and outcomes of 79 patients with multiple myeloma from two academic institutions who had progression of disease after treatment with BCMA-directed CAR T. A total of 237 post-CAR T salvage treatment lines were used, and patients received a median of 2 (range, 1-10) treatment lines. The median overall survival from the date of relapse post-CAR T was 17.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 14.0-NE). The overall response rate to the first salvage regimen was 43.4%, with a median progression-free survival of 3.5 months (CI, 2.5-4.6). Thirty-five (44.3%) patients received a T cell-engaging therapy (bispecific antibody or subsequent CAR T) as salvage treatment. The overall survival in patients that received a subsequent T cell-engaging therapy was not reached after a median follow-up of 21.3 months. Patients with multiple myeloma who relapse after BCMA-directed CAR T have a limited prognosis but can be potentially treated with multiple lines of salvage therapy. T cell-engaging therapies appear to maintain pronounced clinical activity in this setting.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Understanding the complex pathophysiology related to inflammatory infiltrates, extracellular matrix deposition, as well as muscular hyperplasia is crucial to produce high-quality scoring indices for assessing CD strictures. In addition, cross-sectional imaging modalities are the primary tool for diagnosis and follow-up of strictures, especially with the initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy clinical trials. This in turn requires such modalities to both diagnose strictures with high accuracy, as well as be able to delineate the impact of each histomorphologic component on the individual stricture. We discuss the current knowledge on cross-sectional imaging modalities used for stricturing CD, with an emphasis on histomorphologic correlates, novel imaging parameters which may improve segregation between inflammatory, muscular, and fibrotic stricture components, as well as a future outlook on the role of artificial intelligence in this field of gastroenterology.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Although the role of ABCG2 in cancer progression, invasiveness, recurrence are known but its role in metastasis and angiogenesis are not clear. Here, using in vitro (CSCs enriched side population [SP] cells), ex vivo (patient derived primary cells), in ovo (fertilized egg embryo) and in vivo (patient derived primary tissue mediated xenograft (PDX)) system, we have systematically studied the role of ABCG2 in angiogenesis and the regulation of the process by Curcumin (Cur) and Quinacrine (QC). Cur&#8201;+&#8201;QC inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and expression of representative markers of metastasis and angiogenesis. Following hypoxia, ABCG2 enriched cells released angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A) and induced the angiogenesis via PI3K-Akt-eNOS cascade. Cur&#8201;+&#8201;QC inhibited the ABCG2 expression and thus reduced the angiogenesis. Interestingly, overexpression of ABCG2 in SP cells and incubation of purified ABCG2 protein in media induced the angiogenesis but knockdown of ABCG2 decreased the vascularization. In agreement with in vitro results, ex vivo data showed similar phenomena. An induction of vascularization was noticed in PDX mice but reduction of vascularization was also observed after treatment of Cur&#8201;+&#8201;QC. Thus, data suggested that in hypoxia, ABCG2 enhances the production of angiogenesis factor VEGF A which in turn induced angiogenesis and Cur&#8201;+&#8201;QC inhibited the process by inhibiting ABCG2 in breast cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Whether endovascular repair serves as a better strategy than microsurgery remains controversial. We aim to perform a propensity score-matched (PSM) retrospective study to analyze the short-term outcome in BBA patients who received microsurgery and endovascular treatment. One hundred fifty-five eligible patients with internal carotid artery BBA were retrospectively collected with demographic and angiographic baseline in a single center. Three-month outcome and adverse events were set as outcome endpoints. PSM was used to match the microsurgery and endovascular group. Matching effect was evaluated by distribution variation analysis and love plot. The outcome of neurosurgery and endovascular treatment was then compared before and after PSM. Better WFNS levels (p&#8201;=&#8201;.017) and modified Fisher grade (p&#8201;=&#8201;.027) were noted in endovascular group before matching. Other baseline including angiographic features were comparable between two groups. Before matching, the 3-month outcome of endovascular repair surgery was more favorable than microsurgery (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;.0001). The occurrence of adverse events was also higher in the microsurgery group (p&#8201;=&#8201;.0079).

Endovascular surgery of BBAs exhibits overall more favorable short-term outcome regardless of PSM matching.

Preoperative absence of CTCs is associated with dHGP in chemo naive CRLM patients without extrahepatic disease.

The established role of stromal cells in regulating BMP activity in the intestine implies a role for stromal cells in polyp development. We used conditional Cre-LoxP mice to investigate how specific loss of BMPR1A in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts/smooth muscle cells affects intestinal homeostasis. Selective loss of BMPR1A in fibroblasts causes severe histological changes in the intestines with a significant increase in stromal cell content and epithelial cell hyperproliferation, leading to numerous serrated polyps. This phenotype suggests that crucial changes occur in the fibroblast secretome that influences polyp development. Analyses of publicly available RNA expression databases identified CXCL12 as a potential candidate. RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an evident increase of Cxcl12-expressing fibroblasts. In vitro, stimulation of fibroblasts with BMPs resulted in downregulation of CXCL12, while inhibition of the BMP pathway resulted in gradual upregulation of CXCL12 over time. Moreover, neutralization of CXCL12 in vivo in the fibroblast-specific BMPR1A KO mice resulted in a significant decrease in polyp formation. Finally, in CRC patient specimens, mRNA-expression data showed that patients with high GREMLIN1 and CXCL12 expression had a significantly poorer overall survival. Significantly higher GREMLIN1, NOGGIN, and CXCL12 expression were detected in the Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) colorectal cancers, which are thought to arise from serrated polyps. Taken together, these data imply that fibroblast-specific BMP signaling-CXCL12 interaction could have a role in the etiology of serrated polyp formation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

According to the risk of postoperative esophageal stenosis, a risk-scoring model for esophageal strictures prediction was developed. The risk score ranged from 0 to 11 points, and the risk scores were divided into low risk (0-3 points), intermediate risk (4-7 points), and high risk (8-11 points). The proportions of esophageal stenosis progression in the corresponding risk categories were 6.33%, 29.14%, and 100%.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">We developed a risk-scoring model based on factors including circumferential range, lesion location, depth of infiltration, and R0 resection.

To overcome radioresistance and improve treatment outcomes, an understanding of factors that suppress anti-tumor immunity is necessary. In this regard, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical mediators of immune suppression in HNSCCs.

The combined therapy also effectively inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged the survival of the mice, even protected the tumor-free mice from the tumor re-challenge. Both of CpG ODN and TIO3 are indispensable, because replacing CpG ODN with TLR9 inhibitor CCT ODN showed no antitumor effect, CpG ODN or&#160;TIO3 alone did not lead to ideal antitumor results.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Maintenance of stemness is tightly linked to cell cycle regulation through protein phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). However, how this process is reversed during differentiation is unknown. We report here that exit from stemness and differentiation of pluripotent cells along the neural lineage are controlled by CDC14, a CDK-counteracting phosphatase whose function in mammals remains obscure. Lack of the two CDC14 family members, CDC14A and CDC14B, results in deficient development of the neural system in the mouse and impairs neural differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Mechanistically, CDC14 directly dephosphorylates specific proline-directed Ser/Thr residues of undifferentiated embryonic transcription Factor 1 (UTF1) during the exit from stemness, triggering its proteasome-dependent degradation. Multiomic single-cell analysis of transcription and chromatin accessibility in differentiating ESCs suggests that increased UTF1 levels in the absence of CDC14 prevent the proper firing of bivalent promoters required for differentiation. CDC14 phosphatases are dispensable for mitotic exit, suggesting that CDC14 phosphatases have evolved to control stemness rather than cell cycle exit and establish the CDK-CDC14 axis as a critical molecular switch for linking cell cycle regulation and self-renewal.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

However, significant variability in TMB measurement has been observed. We developed contrived bTMB reference materials using DNA from tumor cell lines and donor-matched lymphoblastoid cell lines to support calibration and alignment across laboratories and platforms. Contrived bTMB reference materials were developed using genomic DNA from lung tumor cell lines blended into donor-matched lymphoblastoid cell lines at 0.5% and 2% tumor content, fragmented and size-selected to mirror the size profile of circulating cell-free tumor DNA with TMB scores of 7, 9, 20, and 26 mut/Mb. Variant allele frequency (VAF) and bTMB scores were assessed using PredicineATLAS and GuardantOMNI next-generation sequencing assays. DNA fragment sizes in the contrived reference samples were similar to those found within patient plasma-derived cell-free DNA, and mutational patterns aligned with those in the parental tumor lines. For the 7, 20, and 26 mut/Mb contrived reference samples with 2% tumor content, bTMB scores estimated using either assay aligned with expected scores from the parental tumor cell lines and showed good reproducibility. A bioinformatic filtration step was required to account for low VAF artefact variants. We demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of producing and using bTMB reference standards across a range of bTMB levels, and how such standards could support the calibration and validation of bTMB platforms and help harmonization between panels and laboratories.

The mechanisms underlying the increase in YAP expression and transcriptional activity in PKD remain obscure. We observed that in kidneys from mice with juvenile cystic kidney (jck) ciliopathy, the aberrant hyperactivity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) driven by ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT cascades induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteotoxic stress. To reduce it by reprogramming translation, the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#945; (eIF2&#945;) arm of the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; drove the selective translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), potentiating YAP expression. In parallel, YAP underwent K63-linked polyubiquitination by SCF-S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, a Hippo-independent, nonproteolytic ubiquitination that enhances YAP nuclear trafficking and transcriptional activity in cancer cells. Defective ISR cellular adaptation to ER stress in eIF2&#945;-phosphorylation-deficient jck mice further augmented YAP-mediated transcriptional activity and renal cyst growth. Conversely, pharmacological tuning down of ER stress-ISR activity and SKP2 expression in jck mice by administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) or tolvaptan, impeded these processes. Restoring ER homeostasis, and/or interfering with the SKP2-YAP interaction represent novel potential therapeutic avenues for stemming the progression of renal cystogenesis.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The extended Tofts model was used to quantify the sciatic nerve's microvascular permeability (Ktrans), extravascular extracellular volume fraction (ve), and plasma volume fraction (vp). As a main result, we found that Ktrans correlated positively with HbA1c in patients with DN, while a negative correlation between the two parameters was found in patients without DN.

While PTT induces the ablation of solid tumors, its efficiency is hampered by self-recovery within impaired cancer cells through glycolysis and respiration metabolism.

Herein, nanovesicles (<b>NP1</b>) are integrated by a hypoxia-responsive conjugated polymer (<b>P1</b>), polymetric H<sub>2</sub>S donor (<b>P2</b>), and near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting aza-BODIPY dye (<b>B1</b>) for the delivery of H<sub>2</sub>S and synergistic H<sub>2</sub>S gas therapy/PTT.

Cyanidin produces its effects against cancer probably by inhibiting (RAS, MAPK) and activating (caspases-3 and P-38) innovative molecular pathways. It may cause cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation processes and changes in redox status which trigger the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic effects. However, it also optimizes the chemotherapeutic targets which are cancer cells less responsive to chemotherapy.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Lipid A, the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, serves as a target for cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as polymyxins. Membrane stress from polymyxins results in activation of two-component regulatory systems that produce lipid A modifying enzymes. These enzymes add neutral moieties, such as aminoarabinose (AraN) and ethanolamine (EtN) to lipid A terminal phosphates that mask the phosphate's negative charge and inhibit electrostatic interaction with the cationic polymyxins. Currently, these modifications may be detected by MALDI-TOF MS; however, this analysis is only semiquantitative. Herein we describe a GC-MS method to quantitate lipid A backbone components, glucosamine (GlcN) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), along with terminal phosphate modifications AraN and EtN. In this assay, lipid A is isolated from Gram-negative bacterial samples, hydrolyzed into its individual moieties, and derivatized via methoximation followed by silylation prior to analysis via GC-MS. Changes in AraN and EtN quantity were characterized using a variety of regulatory mutants of <i>Salmonella</i>, revealing differences that were not detected using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Additionally, an increase in the abundance of AraN and EtN modifications were observed when resistant <i>Enterobacter</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains were grown in the presence of colistin (polymyxin E). Lastly, increased levels of Pi were found in bisphosphorylated lipid A compared to monophosphorylated lipid A samples. Because lipid A modifications serve as indicators of polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, this method provides the capacity to monitor polymyxin resistance by quantification of lipid A modification using GC-MS.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Advanced age is the most significant risk factor for AD and approximately two-thirds of cases relate to women. While the previous meta-analysis suggests that estrogen receptor (ESR) genetic polymorphisms are closely associated with dementia, the implications of this observation on a molecular level are not entirely understood. Our study explores this intricate molecular puzzle through the use of a variety of bioinformatics tools. Initially, we attempted to elucidate mechanisms underlying breast cancer development by identifying the high-throughput dataset of <i>ESR1</i>-knockdown breast cancer tissue samples. Surprisingly, KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the most frequently occurring proteins were related to axonal guidance and inflammation-related gene markers. These observations were supported by an external high throughput dataset of AD inflammatory samples <i>in vivo</i>. Our results suggest that <i>ESR1</i> is modulated by apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) through <i>CEBPB/ATF4</i>, mir-155-5p, or mir-1-3p. Moreover, sea hare-hydrolysates (SHH), as one of the axonal guidance molecules, could regulate the STAT3/PRDM1/CEBPB pathway and consequently induce cell death through pyroptosis signaling pathways, trigger the secretion of IL1&#946;, leading to neuroinflammation and worsening AD pathogenesis. Molecular docking verification demonstrated that the predicted natural products scoulerine and genistein displayed strong binding affinities for BACE1 and ESR1, respectively. This strategy can be used to design novel, personalized therapeutic approaches to treatment and a first-in-class clinical lead for the personalised treatment of AD.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Our aim was to examine linear (\"more is better\") and quadratic (\"better near the middle\") associations between components of SES (i.e., income, years of education, occupational status/prestige) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), and to explore moderation by developmental period (adolescence, young, middle, and older adulthood), gender/sex (female, male), and race/ethnicity (Asian American, Black, Latinx, multiracial, Native American, White). We hypothesized that there would be more support for a model containing quadratic associations. We conducted a two-stage meta-analytic structural equation model of 60 data sets (27,242 correlations, 498,179 participants) within the United States, accounting for dependencies between correlations, which were identified via the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research and handled using a two-step approach. Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms, but the quadratic model did not explain more variance in depressive symptoms than the linear model. Developmental period and race/ethnicity moderated the associations: Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among middle-aged adults, and years of education were quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among White samples. Our findings suggest that researchers and clinical practitioners should consider the elevated risk of depressive symptoms for individuals from low and high-income backgrounds in the United States.

The nanothermometer was designed to label the cell membrane by combining metabolic labeling and click chemistry and can leverage ratiometric upconversion luminescence signals to in situ sensitively monitor temperature variation (1.4% K<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover, a purpose-built upconversion hyperspectral microscope was utilized to synchronously map temperature changes on T cell membrane and visualize intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

A systematic review to evaluate the applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in detecting PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in men with PSA levels within the gray zone. The study type is defined as systematic review. In July 2022, out of 229 studies identified by the database search and from other sources, 23 articles related to the selected topic of interest were included in this review. No field strength or sequence restrictions. The data including the study population, study characteristics, as well as basic MRI characteristics, from the final studies included in this review, were extracted independently by two reviewers. The major results of the original study were summarized and no additional statistical analysis was performed. Among the 23 studies included in this review, 17 focused on the applications of MRS and MRI for the prebiopsy diagnosis of PCa. Nine of these 17 articles used Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score to interpret MRI results, thereby confirming the practicality of the PI-RADS score in predicting PCa and csPCa. The remaining six articles evaluated the applications of MRI and MRS in guiding prostate biopsy. Although there was a variation in the biopsy modalities used in these studies, both MRI- and MRS-guided prostate biopsies were observed to improve the detection rates of PCa and csPCa in patients with PSA levels within the gray zone. MRS and MRI showed good performance in the detection of PCa and csPCa before biopsy. In addition, MRS- or MRI-guided prostate-targeted biopsies were able to improve the detection rates of PCa and csPCa.

Morphological, non-targeted metabolomics and 4D label-free proteomics techniques were used to analyze the aortas of db/m mice as normal control group (NCA), saline treated db/db mice (DMA), and hUCMSCs-exos treated db/db mice (DMTA), and to clarify the molecular mechanism of the protection of hUCMSCs-exos in vascular remodeling from a new point of view. The results showed that 74 metabolites were changed significantly in diabetic aortas, of which 15 were almost restored by hUCMSCs-exos. In proteomics, 30 potential targets such as Stromal cell-derived factor 2-like protein 1, Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, Peroxisomal membrane protein and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MYCBP2 were detected. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway-based analysis showed that Central carbon metabolism in cancer and Galactose metabolism pathway were up-regulated to near normal by hUCMSCs-exos in metabolomics, with janus associated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway displayed in proteomics. According to bioinformatics and integrated analysis, these targeted molecules of hUCMSCs-exos to attenuate the vascular remodeling were mainly associated with regulation of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular communications.

Ionizing radiation (IR) promotes PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. However, the effect of IR on macrophage PD-L1 expression and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Development of drugs that specifically target cancer signaling pathways and proteins attain significant importance in the recent past. The p21-activated kinase 4 enzyme, which plays diverse functions in cancer and is reported in elevated expression makes this enzyme an attractive anti-cancer drug target. Similarly, cancer cells' DNA could also serve as a good platform for anti-cancer drug development. Herein, a robust <i>in silico</i> framework is designed to virtually screen multiple drug libraries from diverse sources to identify potential binders of the mentioned cancer targets. The virtual screening process identified three compounds (BAS_01059603, ASN_10027856, and ASN_06916672) as best docked molecules with a binding energy score of &#8804; -10&#8201;kcal/mol for p21-activated kinase 4 and &#8804;&#8201;-6&#8201;kcal/mol for D(CGATCG). In the docking analysis, the filtered compounds revealed stable binding to the same site to which controls bind in X-ray structures. The binding interactions of the compounds with receptors are dominated by van der Waals interactions. The average root mean square deviation (rmsd) value for p21-activated kinase 4 systems is noticed at &#8764;2&#8201;&#197;, while for D(CGATCG), the average rmsd is 2.7&#8201;&#197;. The MMGB/PBSA interpreted ASN_12674021 to show strong intermolecular binding energy compared to the other two systems and control in both receptors. Moreover, the entropy energy contribution is less than the mean binding energy. In short, the compounds are showing promising binding to the biomolecules and therefore must be evaluated for anti-cancer activity in experimental studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Oxidative stress and DNA damage mechanisms may be involved in cisplatin-induced AKI. In this study, we prepared Kolliphor HS15-based myricetin-loaded (HS15-Myr) nanomicelles and explored the mechanism of protection against cisplatin-induced AKI. In vitro results showed that the HS15-Myr nanomicelles enhanced the antioxidant activity of myricetin (Myr) and inhibited cisplatin-induced proliferation inhibition of HK-2 cells. Moreover, the HS15-Myr nanomicelles inhibited cisplatin-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, and DNA damage, which might be related to the inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)&#9472;stimulating interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway. In vivo results in mice showed that the significant reductions in body weight and renal indices and the increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels induced by cisplatin could be significantly reversed by pretreating with the HS15-Myr nanomicelles. Furthermore, nanomicelle pretreatment significantly altered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GSH, MDA, and SOD) induced by cisplatin. In addition, cisplatin-induced inflammatory responses in mouse kidney tissue were found to be inhibited by pretreatment with HS15-Myr nanomicelles, such as IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945; expression. The nanomicelles also significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced activation of the DNA damage-cGAS-STING pathway in kidney tissues. Together, our findings suggest that Myr-loaded nanomicelles are potential nephroprotective drugs.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The use of unique molecular identifiers (UMI) can overcome the limitations of PCR errors and PCR-mediated recombination and reveal the true sampling depth of a viral population being sequenced in an NGS experiment. This approach of enhanced sequence data represents an ideal tool to study both high and low abundance drug resistance mutations and more generally to explore the genetic structure of viral populations. Central to the use of the UMI/Primer ID approach is the creation of a template consensus sequence (TCS) for each genome sequenced. Here we describe a series of experiments to validate several aspects of the Multiplexed Primer ID (MPID) sequencing approach using the MiSeq platform. We have evaluated how multiplexing of cDNA synthesis and amplicons affects the sampling depth of the viral population for each individual cDNA and amplicon to understand the relationship between broader genome coverage versus maximal sequencing depth. We have validated reproducibility of the MPID assay in the detection of minority mutations in viral genomes. We have also examined the determinants that allow sequencing reads of PCR recombinants to contaminate the final TCS data set and show how such contamination can be limited. Finally, we provide several examples where we have applied MPID to analyze features of minority variants and describe limits on their detection in viral populations of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate the generalizable utility of this approach with any RNA virus.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

After median 13.5 months (IQR: 8.5-20.5) follow-up, the median overall survival was NR (95% CI, NR to NR), and median disease free survival was 22.9 (95% CI, 18.6 to 27.3) months. The estimated overall survival at 24 months was 62%. Complete pathological response (pCR) and near pCR was achieved in 23.8% of all patients. Patients with lower NLR or PLR have significantly longer median OS (p = 0.007 and p = 0.033, respectively), and patients with lower NLR have significantly longer median DFS (p = 0.039), but PLR level did not affect DFS (p = 0.062). The OS and DFS of patients with better ECOG performance scores and those who could receive FLOT as adjuvant chemotherapy instead of other regimens were found to be better. NLR was found to be independent prognostic factor for OS in the multivariant analysis. At least one adverse event reported in 57.6% of the patients and grade 3-4 toxicity was seen in 23.6% patients.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"DISCUSSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Real-life perioperative FLOT regimen in operable gastric and GEJ tumors showed similar oncologic outcomes compared to clinical trials. Better performance status, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy as same regimen, low grade and low NLR and PLR improved outcomes in real-life.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Cancer-causing HPV E6 oncoproteins contain a PDZ-binding motif at the extreme carboxy terminus, which plays an important role in the viral life cycle and in the development of malignancy. Through this motif, HPV E6 targets a large number of cellular substrates, many of which are involved in processes related to the regulation of cell polarity. Recent studies also demonstrated E6's PDZ binding motif (PBM)-dependent association with SNX27, with a potential role in the perturbation of endocytic transport. Here, we have performed a proteomic analysis to identify SNX27-interacting partners whose binding to SNX27 is specifically perturbed in an E6-dependent manner. Extracts of HeLa cells that express GFP-tagged SNX27, transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting E6AP, were subject to GFP immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy, which identified TANC2 as an interacting partner of SNX27. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HPV E6 inhibits association between SNX27 and TANC2 in a PBM-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in TANC2 protein levels. In the absence of E6, SNX27 directs TANC2 toward lysosomal degradation. TANC2, in the presence of HPV-18E6, enhances cell proliferation in a PBM-dependent manner, indicating that HPV E6 targets the SNX27-mediated transport of TANC2 to promote cellular proliferation. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> While a great deal is known about the role of the E6 PDZ binding motif (PBM) in modulating the cellular proteins involved in regulating cell polarity, much less is known about the consequences of E6's interactions with SNX27 and the endocytic sorting machinery. We reasoned that a potential consequence of such interactions could be to affect the fate of multiple SNX27 endosomal partners, such as transmembrane proteins or soluble accessory proteins. Using a proteomic approach in HPV-18-positive cervical tumor-derived cells, we demonstrate that TANC2 is an interacting partner of SNX27, whose interaction is blocked by E6 in a PBM-dependent manner. This study therefore begins to shed new light on how E6 can regulate the endocytic transport of multiple SNX27-binding proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of the functions of the E6 PBM.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

While R-M systems are critical in maintaining genome integrity, R-M nucleases unfortunately present significant barriers to targeted genetic modification. Bacteria of the genus <i>Fusobacterium</i> are oral, Gram-negative, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens that are implicated in the progression and severity of multiple cancers and tissue infections, yet our understanding of their direct roles in disease have been severely hindered by their genetic recalcitrance. Here, we demonstrate a path to overcome these barriers in <i>Fusobacterium</i> by using native DNA methylation as a host mimicry strategy to bypass R-M system cleavage of transformed plasmid DNA. We report the identification, characterization, and successful use of Fusobacterium nucleatum type II and III DNA methyltransferase (MTase) enzymes to produce a multifold increase in gene knockout efficiency in the strain Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. <i>nucleatum</i> 23726, as well as the first system for efficient gene knockouts and complementations in F. nucleatum subsp. <i>nucleatum</i> 25586.

Our understanding of how this bacterium modulates human disease has been hindered by a lack of genetic systems. Here, we show that F. nucleatum DNA methyltransferase-modified plasmid DNA overcomes the transformation barrier and has allowed the development of a genetic system in a previously inaccessible strain.

This suggests that CH and early SH in DS are not caused by differential methylation of thyroid-related genes. Considering epigenetic regulation is dynamic, we hypothesize the observed thyroid-related gene DNAm changes could be a rescue phenomenon in an attempt to ameliorate the thyroid phenotype, through epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of decreasing methylation difference of thyroid-related genes with age.

Hypocalcemia has been reported in registration studies, but scanty data are available from real-life cohorts. Aim of our study was to report the prevalence and to describe the characteristics and the management of hypocalcemia in patients on LEN treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We enrolled consecutive patients, followed-up at our single tertiary center, who received LEN for at least six months for advanced TC. Phosphocalcic metabolism and bone mineral density were evaluated during treatment.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">We included 25 patients treated for a mean of 29 &#177; 19 months (range 6-68 months). Hypocalcemia occurred in 6/25 patients (24%), being of grade &#8805;3 in 2/25 patients (8%), and recurrent in 4/6 patients. Median time to onset of hypocalcemia was 3 months (range 0.5-13 months) from LEN start. No differences were found between who developed and who did not develop hypocalcemia regarding either starting and mean dose of LEN or several clinico-pathological characteristics. Patients who developed hypocalcemia had more frequently, albeit not significantly, osteoporosis (75% vs 33.3%) and gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, vomit/nausea, weight loss). During the hypocalcemic crisis, the 2 patients with grade &#8805;3 hypocalcemia had low magnesium and low or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH) levels, while 2/3 patients with grade 2 hypocalcemia had a secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia was managed with calcium oral supplementation or intravenous treatment and with transient LEN withdrawal, when necessary.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Hypocalcemia is frequent during LEN treatment, with a prevalence higher than that reported in the registration SELECT trial (24 vs 6.9%). Both PTH-dependent and PTH-independent mechanisms have been shown to lead to hypocalcemia in the present cohort. Moreover, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal side effects could be considered as predisposing conditions, though further studies are needed to get more insights into other possible risk factors to monitor. Since hypocalcemia can be a life-threatening condition, monitoring of calcium levels is required, in particular during the first year of treatment. Oral calcium supplementation can correct hypocalcemia if promptly diagnosed; however, up to 10% of patients may require intravenous treatment and LEN transient discontinuation.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Among the few available mRNA delivery vehicles, lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is the most clinically advanced one but requires cumbersome four components and suffers from inflammation-related side effects which should be minimized for safety. Yet, a certain level of proinflammatory responses and innate immune activation is required to evoke T-cell immunity for mRNA cancer vaccination. To address these issues and develop potent yet low-inflammatory mRNA cancer vaccine vectors, we synthesized a series of alternating copolymers \"PHTA\" featured with ortho-hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeating units for mRNA delivery, which can play triple roles of condensing mRNA, enhancing the polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) stability, and prolonging circulation time. Unlike the LNPs exhibiting high levels of inflammation, the PHTA-based PNPs showed negligible inflammatory side effects in vivo. Importantly, the top candidate PHTA-C18 enabled successful mRNA cancer vaccine delivery in vivo and led to a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated antitumor cellular immunity. Such PHTA-based integrated PNP provides a potential approach for establishing mRNA cancer vaccines with good inflammatory safety profiles. This article is protected by copyright.

However, with larger or superficial binding sites, it has been extremely difficult to disrupt PPIs with small molecules. On the other hand, intracellular PPIs cannot be targeted by antibodies that cannot penetrate the cell membrane. Peptides that have a combination of conformational rigidity and flexibility can be used to target difficult binding interfaces with appropriate binding affinity and specificity. Since the introduction of insulin nearly a century ago, more than 80 peptide drugs have been approved to treat a variety of diseases. These include deadly diseases such as cancer and human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is also useful against diabetes, chronic pain, and osteoporosis. Today, more research is being done on these drugs as lessons learned from earlier approaches, which are still valid today, complement newer approaches such as peptide display libraries. At the same time, integrated genomics and peptide display libraries are new strategies that open new avenues for peptide drug discovery. The purpose of this review is to examine the problems in elucidating the peptide-protein recognition mechanism. This is important to develop peptide-based interventions that interfere with endogenous protein interactions. New approaches are being developed to improve the binding affinity and specificity of existing approaches and to develop peptide agents as potentially useful drugs. We also highlight the key challenges that must be overcome in peptide drug development to realize their potential and provide an overview of recent trends in peptide drug development. In addition, we take an in-depth look at early efforts in human hormone discovery, smart medicinal chemistry and design, natural peptide drugs, and breakthrough advances in molecular biology and peptide chemistry.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

A total of 144 patients who met the same criteria from our center (Peking Union Medical College Hospital) were placed in the external test cohort. The cancer-specific survival rate (CSS) at 1, 3, and 5 years was set as the research outcome. Then, four ML models, i.e., a gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), were established. Fifteen potential independent features were included in this study.&#160; Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Seven clinical features, namely pathological grade, T stage, N stage, number of metastatic sites, brain or liver metastases, and metastasectomy were selected for subsequent analysis via the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. In conclusion, the GBM model performed best at 1-, 3- and 5-year CSS prediction (0.836, 0.819 and 0.808, respectively in the internal test cohort and 0.819, 0.805 and 0.786, respectively in the external cohort).

Despite multidisciplinary efforts, therapies to fight various types of cancer still remain inefficient. Reducing high recurrence rates and mortality is thus a major challenge to tackle. In this context, redox imbalance is an undervalued characteristic of cancer. However, it may be targeted by boron- and phosphorus-containing materials to selectively or systemically fight cancer. In particular, boron and phosphorus derivatives are attractive building blocks for rational drug discovery due to their unique and wide regioselective chemistry, high degree of tuneability and chemical stability. Thus, they can be meticulously employed to access tunable molecular platforms to selectively exploit the redox imbalance of cancer cells towards necrosis/apoptosis. This field of research holds a remarkable potential; nevertheless, it is still in its infancy. In this mini-review, we underline recent advances in the development of boron- or phosphorus-derivatives as molecular/nano platforms for rational anticancer drug design.

The ability to prevent oxidative stress induced diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and others has been the subject of global research.

Our present research uses computational studies to identify a molecule with anti-inflammatory properties that can operate as an NRF2 activator. Acquiring and preparing the KEAP1-NRF2 Protein (PDB: 4L7D) with Schrodinger Suite was followed by developing a ligand library (Anti-inflammatory library downloaded from ChemDiv database). Molecular docking studies were performed in HTVS, SP, and XP modes, respectively. Based on the docking score, interaction, ADMET and binding free energy, the top ten compounds were selected and subjected to induced-fit docking (IFD) analysis for further study. The top three molecules were chosen for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Using the Desmond module of the Schrodinger Suite, the stability of the protein-ligand complex and protein-ligand contact throughout 100ns were evaluated during the MD simulation study. In our study, it was observed that three compounds exhibit exceptional stability and retain the essential interaction throughout the studies, and it is anticipated that these compounds may act as effective NRF2 activators.

The internal chemical modification of the target RNA at a specific site is a basic feature of epitranscriptomics and is critical for its structural stability and functional property. More than 170 modifications at the transcriptomic level have been reported so far, among which m6A methylation is one of the more conserved internal RNA modifications, abundantly found in eukaryotic mRNAs and frequently involved in enhancing the target messenger RNA\\'s (mRNA) stability and translation. m6A modification of mRNAs is essential for multiple physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, nervous system development and gametogenesis. Any aberration in the m6A modification can often result in a pathological condition. The deregulation of m6A methylation has already been described in inflammation, viral infection, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The m6A modification is reversible in nature and is carried out by specialized m6A proteins including writers (m6A methyltransferases) that add methyl groups and erasers (m6A demethylases) that remove methyl groups selectively. The fate of m6A-modified mRNA is heavily reliant on the various m6A-binding proteins (\"readers\") which recognize and generate a functional signal from m6A-modified mRNA.

Recent reports of the efficacy of vedolizumab in treating lower GI acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) are promising, but experience in children is scarce. We present a cohort of 13 pediatric patients who were treated with vedolizumab for GI aGVHD. Ten of the patients were treated for steroid-refractory disease, out of which, six suffered from severe (stage 3 or 4) GI disease before the first dose of vedolizumab. In the other three patients, vedolizumab was introduced early in the disease course. Median time between GI GVHD onset to vedolizumab treatment was 23 days (range 7-59 days), with a median of 3 doses (range 1-5) per patient. GI GVHD staging was evaluated at various time points after the first vedolizumab dose, showing improvement in nine of the 13 patients. After a median follow-up time of 13 months (range 6-34 months), eight patients completely recovered, two had ongoing chronic colitis, and three&#160;patients died. During the vedolizumab treatment period, 38 infectious episodes were noted, most of them GI related. The unique activity profile of vedolizumab makes it an appealing treatment option for lower GI aGVHD, but caution for concurrent infections is warranted.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Firstly, the monoMonoKGap method is used to extract the characteristic of anticancer peptide sequences and form the digital features. Then, the AdaBoost model is used to select the most discriminating features from the digital features. Finally, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm is introduced to identify anticancer peptide sequences.

Hyperglycemia can result in increased glycation, the process wherein crosslinkages are formed between sugars and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins through the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Although accumulation of AGEs occurs naturally <i>in vivo</i> over time, it is greatly accelerated by the hyperglycemic environment of diabetic patients. AGE accumulation has been linked to stiffening-related diseases such as hypertension, cancer metastasis, and neurodegenerative disorders. In response, several AGE-inhibiting and AGE-breaking drugs have received significant attention for their ability to reduce AGE accumulation. The resulting effects of these drugs on cell behavior is not well understood. In this study, we measured cancer cell migration in glycated collagen with and without the AGE-breaking drug alagebrium chloride (ALT711) to investigate the drug's ability to disrupt ECM crosslinks and reduce tumor cell spreading, contractility, and migration. The mechanical properties and chemical composition of collagen glycated with increasing concentrations of glucose with and without ALT711 treatment were measured. Increasing glucose concentration resulted in increased AGE accumulation and matrix stiffness as well as increased cancer cell contractility, elongation, and migration. Treatment with ALT711 significantly lowered AGE accumulation within the collagen, decreased collagen stiffness, and reduced cell migration. These findings suggest that while hyperglycemia can increase collagen matrix stiffness, resulting in increased breast cancer cell migration, an AGE-breaker can reverse this phenotype and may be a viable treatment option for reducing cancer cell migration due to glycation.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Here, we show that 2 structural cardiac diseases, left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and bicuspid aortic valve, can be caused by a set of inherited heterozygous gene mutations affecting the NOTCH ligand regulator MIB1 (MINDBOMB1) and cosegregating genes.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate mice harboring a nonsense or a missense <i>MIB1</i> mutation that are both found in LVNC families. We also generated mice separately carrying these <i>MIB1</i> mutations plus 5 additional cosegregating variants in the <i>ASXL3</i>, <i>APCDD1</i>, <i>TMX3, CEP192</i>, and <i>BCL7A</i> genes identified in these LVNC families by whole exome sequencing. Histological, developmental, and functional analyses of these mouse models were carried out by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, together with gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing of both selected engineered mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Potential biochemical interactions were assayed in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Mice homozygous for the <i>MIB1</i> nonsense mutation did not survive, and the mutation caused LVNC only in heteroallelic combination with a conditional allele inactivated in the myocardium. The heterozygous <i>MIB1</i> missense allele leads to bicuspid aortic valve in a NOTCH-sensitized genetic background. These data suggest that development of LVNC is influenced by genetic modifiers present in affected families, whereas valve defects are highly sensitive to NOTCH haploinsufficiency. Whole exome sequencing of LVNC families revealed single-nucleotide gene variants of <i>ASXL3</i>, <i>APCDD1</i>, <i>TMX3, CEP192</i>, and <i>BCL7A</i> cosegregating with the <i>MIB1</i> mutations and LVNC. In experiments with mice harboring the orthologous variants on the corresponding <i>Mib1</i> backgrounds, triple heterozygous <i>Mib1 Apcdd1 Asxl3</i> mice showed LVNC, whereas quadruple heterozygous <i>Mib1 Cep192 Tmx3;Bcl7a</i> mice developed bicuspid aortic valve and other valve-associated defects. Biochemical analysis suggested interactions between CEP192, BCL7A, and NOTCH. Gene expression profiling of mutant mouse hearts and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes revealed increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and defective morphological and metabolic maturation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">These findings reveal a shared genetic substrate underlying LVNC and bicuspid aortic valve in which MIB1-NOTCH variants plays a crucial role in heterozygous combination with cosegregating genetic modifiers.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Genetic information has been crucial to understand the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) at diagnosis and at relapse, but still nowadays has a limited value in a clinical context. Few genetic markers are associated with the outcome of T-ALL patients, independently of measurable residual disease (MRD) status after therapy. In addition, the prognostic relevance of genetic features may be modulated by the specific treatment used. We analyzed the genetic profile of 145 T-ALL patients by targeted deep sequencing. Genomic information was integrated with the clinical-biological and survival data of a subset of 116 adult patients enrolled in two consecutive MRD-oriented trials of the Spanish PETHEMA (Programa Espa&#241;ol de Tratamientos en Hematolog&#237;a) group. Genetic analysis revealed a mutational profile defined by DNMT3A/ N/KRAS/ MSH2/ U2AF1 gene mutations that identified refractory/resistant patients. Mutations in the DMNT3A gene were also found in the nonleukemic cell fraction of patients with T-ALL, revealing a possible mutational-driven clonal hematopoiesis event to prime T-ALL in elderly. The prognostic impact of this adverse genetic profile was independent of MRD status on day +35 of induction therapy. The combined WOG signature and MRD on day +35 allowed risk-stratification of T-ALL into standard or high-risk groups with significantly different 5-year overall survival (OS) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 52% (37-67 %) and 17% (1-33%), respectively. These results confirm the relevance of the tumor genetic profile in predicting patient outcome in adult T-ALL and highlight the need for novel gene-targeted chemotherapeutic schedules to improve the OS of poor-prognosis T-ALL patients.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

But vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches used for radical trachelectomy with pelvic PLND cause peritoneal damage, which could result in periadnexal adhesion. Here, we propose the&#160;neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (NACT) with the&#160;vaginal radical trachelectomy with retroperitoneal PLND as a fertility-preserving option for early stage cervical cancer patients. VRT with retroperitoneal PLND was performed in three women with FIGO 2018&#160;stage IB2&#160;and IIA1&#160;cervical cancers. In all three patients, complete response was achieved without causing any intraoperative and severe postoperative complications. NACT for fertility sparing treatment is an innovative approach, which is potentially quite interesting for many young women affected by cervical cancer with the&#160;tumor size &gt;2&#160;cm. Vaginal radical trachelectomy with retroperitoneal PLND can be safely performed and peritoneal damage, which can cause periadnexal adhesion, could be avoided.

However, the mutagenic effects of some of these proteins compromise genomic integrity and may promote tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that human APOBEC3G (A3G), in addition to its role in innate immunity, promotes repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic mice expressing A3G successfully survived lethal irradiation, whereas wild-type controls quickly succumbed to radiation syndrome. Mass spectrometric analyses identified the differential up-regulation of a plethora of proteins involved in DSB repair pathways in A3G-expressing cells early following irradiation to facilitate repair. Importantly, we find that A3G not only accelerates DSB repair, but also promotes deamination-dependent error-free rejoining. These findings have two implications: (i) strategies aimed at inhibiting A3G may improve the efficacy of genotoxic therapies used to cure malignant tumors; and (ii) enhancing A3G activity may reduce acute radiation syndrome in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

We tune material composition and formulation in each of these contexts to enable glycemic control in diabetic mice. For injectable, glucose-responsive insulin delivery, 0.5&#160;mm 2.5% oxidized alginate microgels facilitate repeat dosing and consistently provide 10 days of glycemic control.

Here, we decipher how specific sulfation patterns on HS and CS regulate receptor-mediated homing of nanoprobes in primary and secondary cells. We discovered that aggressive cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 displayed a strong uptake of GAG-nanoprobes compared to mild or moderate aggressive cancer cells. However, there was no selectivity towards the GAG sequences, indicating the presence of more than one receptor mediated uptake. Whereas U87 cells, olfactory bulb and hippocampal primary neurons showed selective or preferential uptake of CS-E coated nanoprobes compared to other GAG-nanoprobes.

In its intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway opposing members of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family meet at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) to control its integrity. Any imbalance can cause disorders, with upregulation of the cell-guarding anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein itself being common in many, often incurable cancers. Normally, the Bcl-2 protein itself is embedded in the MOM where it sequesters cell-killing apoptotic proteins such as Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) which would otherwise perforate the MOM and subsequently cause cell death. However, the molecular basis of Bcl-2's ability to recognize those apoptotic proteins via their common BH3 death motifs remains elusive due to the lack of structural insight. By employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on fully functional human Bcl-2 protein in membrane-mimicking micelles, we identified glycine residues across all functional domains of the Bcl-2 protein, and could monitor their residue specific individual response upon the presence of a Bax-derived 36 aa long BH3 domain. The observed chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) allowed us to determine the response and individual affinity of each glycine residue and provide an overall picture of the individual roles by which Bcl-2's functional domains engage in recognizing and inhibiting apoptotic proteins via their prominent BH3 motifs. This way, we provide a unique residue and domain specific insight into the molecular functioning of Bcl-2 at the membrane level; an insight also opening up for interfering with this cell-protecting mechanism in cancer therapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Biophysical Society.

Although primary tumor removal is widely accepted as beneficial, it has long been suspected that surgery itself contributes to accelerated metastatic recurrence. We investigated surgical wounding's impact on tumor progression and lung metastasis in a murine model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Ten-week-old female mice were inoculated with 4&#160;T1 cells (week 0) and were either subjected to a 2&#160;cm long cutaneous contralateral incision (wounded) or control (non-wounded) on week 2 and monitored for 3&#8201;weeks (week 5). Mice with surgical wounding displayed significantly accelerated tumor growth observable as early as 1-week post wounding. This was confirmed by increased tumor volume and tumor weight, post-mortem. Further, surgical wounding increased metastasis to the lungs, as detected by IVIS imaging, in vivo and ex vivo (week 5). As expected then, wounded mice displayed decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in both the primary tumor and in the lungs. Flow cytometry revealed that primary tumors from wounded mice exhibited increased tumor associated macrophages and specifically M2-like macrophages, which are important in promoting tumor development, maintenance, and metastasis. Immunofluorescence staining and gene expression data further confirms an increase in macrophages in both the primary tumor and the lungs of wounded mice. Our data suggests that surgical wounding accelerates tumor progression and lung metastasis in a mouse model of TNBC, which is likely mediated, at least in part by an increase in macrophages.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

During the last decade, dysregulation of the mRNA translation process in pancreatic cancer has been widely reported, and shown to critically impact on cancer initiation, development and survival. This includes translation dysregulation of mRNAs encoding oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Hence, cancer cells survive a stressful microenvironment through a flexible regulation of translation initiation for rapid adaptation. The ISR pathway has an important role in chemoresistance and shows high potential therapeutic interest. Despite the numerous translational alterations reported in pancreatic cancer, their consequences are greatly underestimated.

Most of these compounds exhibited remarkable activity against the Axl kinase. In particular, the promising compound m16 showed the highest enzymatic inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) and blocked multiple tumor cells' proliferation potencies (the CC<sub>50</sub> of 4 out of 42 cancer cell lines &lt;100 nM). Furthermore, compound m16 also possessed preferable pharmacokinetic profiles and liver microsome stability. All these favorable results make m16 a good leading therapeutic candidate for further development.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Probes containing the sulfonyl fluoride warhead have also been shown to serendipitously label histidine residues in proteins. Histidine targeting is an attractive prospect because the residue is frequently proximal to protein small molecule ligands and the imidazole side chain possesses desirable nucleophilicity.

Conventional radiotherapy with photons, along with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, is the mainstay for treatment of GBM although no significant improvement in survival rates has been observed over the last 20 years. Inherent factors such as tumor hypoxia, radioresistant GBM stem cells, and upregulated DNA damage response mechanisms are well established as contributing to treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. While it is understandable that efforts have focused on targeting these factors to overcome this phenotype, there have also been striking advances in precision radiotherapy techniques, including proton beam therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). These enable higher doses of radiation to be delivered precisely to the tumor, while minimizing doses to surrounding normal tissues and organs at risk. These alternative radiotherapy techniques also benefit from increased biological effectiveness, particularly in the case of CIRT. Although not researched extensively to date, combining these new radiation modalities with radio-enhancing agents may be particularly effective in improving outcomes for patients with GBM.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we have undertaken an untargeted metabolomic analysis by liquid chromatography-high-resolution spectrometry combined with cytotoxicity assay, western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and fatty acid oxidation in a prostate cancer cell line resistant to the antiandrogen 2-hydroxiflutamide with features of cancer stem cells, compared to its parental androgen-sensitive cell line.

Pathway analysis performed with the unequivocally identified metabolites, revealed changes in pathways involved in energy metabolism as well as posttranscriptional regulation. Validation by enzyme expression analysis indicated that the chemotherapy-resistant prostate cancer stem cells were metabolically dormant with decreased fatty acid oxidation, methionine metabolism and ADP-ribosylation.

On the other hand, how the affinity and engaging kinetics of antigen-binding domain (ABD) affects the CART's efficacy has not been carefully investigated. In this article, we first analyzed 38 published solid tumor CART trials and correlated the response rate to their ABD affinity. Not surprisingly, majority (25 trials) of the CARTs utilized high-affinity ABDs, but generated merely 5.7% response rate. In contrast, 35% of the patients treated with the CARTs built from moderate-affinity ABDs had clinical responses. Thus, CARTs with moderate-affinity ABDs not only have less off-target toxicity, but also are more effective. We then reviewed the effects of ABD affinity on the biology and function of CARTs, providing further evidence that moderate-affinity ABDs may be better in CART development. In the end, we propose that a fast-on/fast-off (high <i>K<sub>on</sub></i> and <i>K<sub>off</sub></i> ) kinetics of CART-target engagement in solid tumor allow CARTs to generate sufficient signaling to kill tumor cells without being driven to exhaustion.

Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to construct a prognostic Meta-model based on all combinations of metabolism-related features. Then the correlation between MetaScore and tumor was deeply explored from prognostic, genomic variant, functional and immunological perspectives, and chemo-/immuno-therapy response. Multiple algorithms were applied to estimate the immunotherapeutic responses of two MeteScore groups. Further <i>in vitro</i> functional experiments were performed using PCa cells to validate the association between the expression of hub gene SLC17A4 which is one of the model component genes and tumor progression. GDSC database was employed to determine the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"Results\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Two metabolism-related clusters presented different features in overall survival (OS). A metabolic model was developed weighted by the estimated regression coefficients in the multivariate Cox regression analysis (0.5154*GAS2 + 0.395*SLC17A4 - 0.1211*NTM + 0.2939*GC). This Meta-scoring system highlights the relationship between the metabolic profiles and genomic alterations, gene pathways, functional annotation, and tumor microenvironment including stromal, immune cells, and immune checkpoint in PCa. Low MetaScore is correlated with increased mutation burden and microsatellite instability, indicating a superior response to immunotherapy. Several medications that might improve patients` prognosis in the MetaScore group were identified. Additionally, our cellular experiments suggested knock-down of SLC17A4 contributes to inhibiting invasion, colony formation, and proliferation in PCa cells <i>in vitro</i>.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"Conclusions\" NlmCategory=\"UNASSIGNED\">Our study supports the metabolism-based four-gene signature as a novel and robust model for predicting prognosis, and chemo-/immuno-therapy response in PCa patients.

Tumour molecular subtypes and prognostic biomarkers play a crucial role in LGG diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers in LGG patients is crucial for predicting the prognosis of glioma. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is defined as regulated cell death that is sufficient to activate the adaptive immune response of immunocompetent hosts. The combination of ICD and immunotherapy might exert a greater and more persistent antitumour effect in gliomas. In our study, we explored the expression, function, and genetic alterations of 34 ICD-related genes. Using 12 ICD-related genes, including IL17RA, IL1R1, EIF2AK3, CD4, PRF1, CXCR3, CD8A, BAX, PDIA3, CASP8, MYD88, and CASP1, we constructed and validated an ICD-related risk signature <i>via</i> least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. All the information was obtained from public databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Our results revealed that ICD-high risk groups have a poor prognosis and might be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In addition, ICD-high risk groups were associated with 1p19q noncodeletion, higher WHO grade, wild type IDH, and an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. We verified the prognostic value of 12 ICD-related genes in TCGA and CGGA databases. Immunohistochemistry was performed to verify the expression of several ICD-related genes at the protein level.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Macrophages play an important role in tissue homeostasis, tissue remodeling, immune response, and progression of cancer. Consequently, macrophages exhibit significant plasticity and change their transcriptional profile and function in response to environmental, tissue, and inflammatory stimuli resulting in pro- and anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, the categorization of tissue macrophages in inflammatory situations remains difficult; however, there is an agreement that macrophages are predominantly polarized into two different subtypes with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, the so-called M1-like and M2-like macrophages, respectively. These two macrophage classes can be considered as the extreme borders of a continuum of many intermediate subsets. On one end, M1 are pro-inflammatory macrophages that initiate an immunological response, damage tissue integrity, and dampen tumor progression by fostering robust T and natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumoral responses. On the other end, M2 are anti-inflammatory macrophages involved in tissue remodeling and tumor growth, that promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and that participate to immune suppression. These decisive roles in tumor progression occur through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases, as well as by the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in the case of M2 macrophages. Moreover, macrophage plasticity is supported by stimuli from the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) that are relayed to the nucleus through membrane receptors and signaling pathways that result in gene expression reprogramming in macrophages, thus giving rise to different macrophage polarization outcomes. In this review, we will focus on the main signaling pathways involved in macrophage polarization that are activated upon ligand-receptor recognition and in the presence of other immunomodulatory molecules in cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Kerneur, Cano and Olive.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

However, the detailed mechanisms of the <i>&#946;</i>-carboline dimers in inhibiting sarcoma (SARC) remain unclear. The results showed that <i>&#946;</i>-carboline-3-carboxylic acid dimers Comp1 and Comp2, which were synthesized in our lab and modified at the N<sup>9</sup> position and linked at the C<sup>3</sup> position, exhibited effective inhibition activity on MG-63 proliferation (IC<sub>50 =</sub> 4.6&#956;M). Meanwhile, the large scale transcriptome profiles of SARC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed, and found that abnormal expression of genes relevant to apoptosis, cell cycle, and signaling pathways of Hedgehog, HIF, Ras involved in the SARC pathogenesis. Interestingly, both dimers could promote the apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle in S phase to inhibit proliferation of MG-63. Moreover, Comp1 and Comp2 inhibited the expression <i>CDK2</i>, <i>CCNA2</i>, <i>DBF4</i>, and <i>PLK1</i> associated with various immune cells and cell cycle in MG-63. Remarkably, drug-target interaction network analysis showed that numerous proteins involved in cell cycle were the potential targets of Comp1 and Comp2, especially CCNA2. Further molecular docking, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) confirmed that both dimers could directly interact with CCNA2, which is significantly correlated with CD4+ T cells, by strong hydrophobic interactions (K<sub>d</sub>=5.821 &#215;10<sup>6</sup> N). Meanwhile, the levels of CCNA2 and CDK2 were inhibited to decrease in MG-63 by both dimer treatments at transcription and protein levels, implying that Comp1 and Comp2 blocked the interaction between CCNA2 and CDK2 through competitive binding with CCNA2 to arrest the cell cycle of MG-63 cells in the S phase. Additionally, the transcriptome profiles of <i>&#946;</i>-carboline-treated mice from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were obtained, and found that similar antitumor mechanism was shared among <i>&#946;</i>-carboline derivatives. Overall, our results elucidated the antitumor mechanisms of Comp1 and Comp2 through dual-suppressing the function of CCNA2 to profoundly arrest cell cycle of MG-63, then effectively inhibited cell proliferation of MG-63.

To test this US-Unet model, we calculated the blood oxygenation saturation values and total hemoglobin concentrations from 655 regions of interest (ROIs) (421 benign, 200 malignant, and 34 borderline ROIs) obtained from clinical images of 35 patients with ovarian/adnexal lesions. A logistic regression model was used to compute the ROC, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.94, and the accuracy was 0.89.

The cytotoxic activity of curcumin (Cur)/miR-34a-loaded nanoparticles was determined by the MTT assay<i>.</i> The results displayed an improved cytotoxic activity of Cur-niosome towards cancer cells compared to free-dispersed Cur. The uptake of Cur-loaded niosome by A280s and A280cp-1 cancer cell lines faced 2.5 folds drop in the concentration compared to its free form. Generally, Cur-niosome exhibits a significant accumulation of superior anti-cancer properties. Likewise, the cytotoxicity of miR-34a-niosome against tumor cells was higher in comparison with its free form. The anti-cancer effects of the gene/drug delivery were investigated in the 4T1 xenografted Balb/C mouse tumor model. According to the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results, gene delivery from the modified niosome nanoparticles was distinctly greater than Cur delivery.

Here, we aimed at characterizing circulating lymphocytes and plasma proteins in relation to clinical parameters and treatment effect. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained from 48 consecutive patients at diagnosis and at 2 time points after successful primary treatment. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from lymph node (LN) biopsies obtained for routine diagnostic purposes. Twenty healthy individuals were included as controls. Cells from PB and LN were analyzed by flow cytometry, and plasma proteins by Proximity Extension Assay. We found that the frequencies of T and B cells positively correlated between the LN and the PB compartments. Compared to controls, cHL patients had higher frequencies of proliferating T cells as well as higher expression of programmed death (PD)-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 in circulating T cells, and lower naive T-cell frequencies. Advanced-stage patients had fewer NK cells with a functionally impaired phenotype. Differences in the immune profile were observed in patients with a high tumor burden and with high inflammation, respectively. Most of these deviations disappeared after standard first-line treatment. Patients who received radiotherapy involving the mediastinum had low T-cell counts for a prolonged period.

An example of the complexities related to adoption of vaccine policies in the United States (US) is the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine school-entry requirement. In 2018, Puerto Rico's (PR) Department of Health adopted this policy. This study assessed stakeholders' recommendations for adoption of the HPV vaccine school-entry requirement that could inform future vaccine policies. Stakeholders (e.g., researchers, members of medical and non-profit organizations) were interviewed from May to August 2018. Participants (n&#160;=&#160;20) discussed recommendations for public health professionals interested in adopting such policy. Data were analyzed using applied thematic techniques. Participants emphasized the importance of raising HPV vaccine awareness and providing education prior to the requirement. They recommended using real stories and making the problem relevant by using local data. Participants recommended considering the local culture and government bureaucracies, and promoting multisectoral collaborations to combine limited resources. The combination of education efforts, local data, and multisectoral collaborations facilitated the adoption of the HPV vaccine school-entry requirement in PR. Findings highlight the need to understand the contextual distinctions of the communities where vaccination requirements may be adopted and implemented to anticipate barriers and leverage existing resources. Consideration of the politico-cultural context may be important as political beliefs have become entrenched with vaccine policy. These practical lessons can inform public health professionals and policymakers who are seeking to adopt and implement vaccine policies in other settings to ensure equitable vaccine access.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the prospective literature on QOL in&#160;patients with early-stage NSCLC after treatment with SBRT or surgery. A comprehensive literature review using PubMed and EMBASE was performed in April 2022. Prospective studies evaluating QOL data across multiple time points in patients with early-stage NSCLC after SBRT or surgery were included. A total of 25 studies involving 1597 SBRT patients and 1652 surgery patients met the inclusion criteria. Across most studies, QOL remained stable after treatment with SBRT. After surgery, QOL initially decreased; however, it often returned to baseline in the next 6 to 12 months. Utilization of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and sublobar resection reduced the magnitude of the initial decrease in QOL after surgery and led to faster recovery to baseline. Owing to the heterogeneity of patient populations between studies evaluating SBRT versus surgery, direct comparisons between the two treatments remain difficult to make. Clinicians should appropriately counsel patients with this information to help guide patient-centered discussions on choosing the optimal treatment modality.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Defects in lysosomal enzymes and functions lead to lysosome-related diseases, including lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, activation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, especially induction of lysosomal biogenesis, might be an effective strategy for the treatment of lysosome-related diseases. In this study, we established a lysosome-based screening system to identify active compounds from natural products that could promote lysosomal biogenesis. The subcellular localizations of master transcriptional regulators of lysosomal genes, TFEB, TFE3 and ZKSCAN3 were examined to reveal the potential mechanisms.

One important member of this family is the protein known as Permeability Glycoprotein (P-Glycoprotein, P-gp or ABCB1). Its clinical relevance relies mainly on the fact that the inhibition of P-gp and other ABC transporters could result in the reversal of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in some patients.

Historically, neoadjuvant administration of cisplatin-based therapy followed by surgery has been the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately, of patients who come in with initially diagnosed MIBC, more than 50% are ineligible for traditional cisplatin-based therapy. Today, new modalities of treatment such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are beginning to radically improve outcomes in this population. The addition of immune checkpoint therapy to traditional chemotherapy appears to augment pathologic complete response rates in the bladder during surgery. Immunotherapy combinations also provide novel trimodality approaches with excellent outcomes in those pursuing non-surgical management. Pure immunotherapy approaches appear promising in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab is now approved in the adjuvant setting for high-risk patients.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Metastasis is tightly linked with poor cancer prognosis, yet it is not clear how transformed cells become invasive carcinomas. We previously discovered that single KRas<sup>V12</sup>-transformed cells can invade directly from the epithelium by basal cell extrusion. During this process, cells de-differentiate by mechanically pinching off their epithelial determinants, but how they <i>trans</i>-differentiate into a migratory, mesenchymal phenotype is not known. Here, we demonstrate that basally extruded KRas<sup>V12</sup>-expressing cells become significantly deformed as they invade the zebrafish body. Decreasing the confinement that cells experience after they invade reduces the percentage of KRas<sup>V12</sup> cells that <i>trans</i>-differentiate into mesenchymal cell types, while higher confinement increases this percentage. Additionally, increased confinement promotes accumulation of internal masses over time. Altogether, our results suggest that mechanical forces drive not only de-differentiation of KRas<sup>V12</sup>-transformed epithelial cells as they invade but also their re-differentiation into mesenchymal phenotypes that contribute to distant metastases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Glioma cell-intrinsic TIM-3 is involved in not only regulating malignant behaviors of glioma cells but also inducing macrophage migration and transition to anti-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic phenotype by a TIM-3/interleukin 6 (IL6) signal. In mechanism, as one of the major regulators of IL6, TIM-3 regulates its expression through activating NF-&#954;B. Blocking this feedback loop by Tocilizumab, an IL6R inhibitor, inhibited the above effects and repressed the tumorigenicity of GBM <i>in&#160;vivo</i>.

In addition, cancer professionals are notoriously time-poor, meaning there is a need for high quality, accessible and tailored oncological education programs. Digital learning (DL) is well-placed to cater to these needs, as it provides teaching options that can be delivered flexibly and on-demand from anywhere in the world. The evidence for usage of these techniques in medical education has expanded rapidly in recent years. However, there remains many reservations in the oncological community to adopting and developing DL, largely due to a poor familiarity with the pedagogical evidence base. This article will review the application of the screen-based DL tools that are at educators' disposal. It will summarize best-practice in developing tailored, made-for-screen videos, gamification, and infographics. It also reviews data behind the following practical tips of 1) strategically combining text with graphics to decrease cognitive load, 2) engaging users through use of interactive elements in digital content, and 3) maximizing impact through thoughtful organization of animations/images. Overall, the digital space evolving is well placed to cater to the evolving educational needs of oncology learners. This review and its practical tips aim to inspire further development in this arena, production of high-yield educational products, use of engaging delivery methods and programs that are tailored to individual learning needs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Therefore, targeting tumor-associated macrophages is a possible strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. <b>Purpose:</b> We would like to investigate the role of sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) and the effect of the synthase 2 selective inhibitor YE2 in TAMs and the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. In addition, we also would like to investigate the mechanism by which YE2 attenuates macrophage M2 polarization. <b>Methods:</b> YE2 was utilized to treat macrophages (<i>in vitro</i>) and mice (<i>in vivo</i>). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect the protein levels and mRNA levels of macrophage M2 polarization markers and their downstream signaling pathways. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 gene knockout (KO) mice and their controls were used to establish a PANC-02 orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, and immune cell infiltration in the tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). <b>Results:</b> We found that sphingomyelin synthase 2 mRNA expression is positively correlated with tumor-associated macrophages, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 deficiency was confirmed to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of orthotopic PANC-02 tumors <i>in vivo</i>. The deficiency not only reduced the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages but also regulated other immune components in the tumor microenvironment. In tissue culture, YE2 inhibited M2 polarization in both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and THP-1 macrophages and eliminated the protumor effect of M2 macrophages. In the mouse model, YE2 treatment reduced the infiltration of TAMs and regulated other immune components in the tumor microenvironment, slowing the progression of PANC-02 tumors. In terms of mechanism, we found that the inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase 2 could downregulate the expression of IL4R&#945; and CSF1R, thereby attenuating M2 polarization. <b>Conclusion:</b> The sphingomyelin synthase 2 inhibitor YE2 or sphingomyelin synthase 2 deficiency can prevent macrophage M2 polarization in pancreatic cancer, and sphingomyelin synthase 2 could be a new potential target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 He, Gu, Yang, Xu, Hu, Wang, Huang, Lou, Ding, Zhou, Ye, Yu and Dong.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

The disease is characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, chest tightness and variable airflow limitation for which there is no cure and is symptomatically treated with inhaled corticosteroids and &#946;2-agonists. Molecular mechanisms underlying its complex pathogenesis are not fully understood. However, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), a DNA repair protein may play a central role, as OGG1 deficiency decreases both innate and allergic inflammation. <b>Methods:</b> Using a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic airway inflammation we assessed the utility of an inhibitor of OGG1 (TH5487) in this disease context. Cytokines and chemokines, promoting immune cell recruitment were measured using a 23-multiplex assay and Western blotting. Additionally, immune cell recruitment to bronchi was measured using flow cytometry. Histological analyses and immunofluorescent staining were used to confirm immune cell influx and goblet cell hyperplasia of the airways. A PCR array was used to assess asthma-related genes in murine lung tissue following TH5487 treatment. Finally, airway hyperresponsiveness was determined using <i>in vivo</i> lung function measurement. <b>Results:</b> In this study, administration of TH5487 to mice with OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation significantly decreased goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production. TH5487 treatment also decreased levels of activated NF-&#954;B and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in significantly lower recruitment of eosinophils and other immune cells to the lungs. Gene expression profiling of asthma and allergy-related proteins after TH5487 treatment revealed differences in several important regulators, including down regulation of <i>Tnfrsf4, Arg1, Ccl12</i> and <i>Ccl11</i>, and upregulation of the negative regulator of type 2 inflammation, <i>Bcl6</i>. Furthermore, the gene <i>Clca1</i> was upregulated following TH5487 treatment, which should be explored further due to its ambiguous role in allergic asthma. In addition, the OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly reduced by TH5487 treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> Taken together, the data presented in this study suggest OGG1 as a clinically relevant pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic inflammation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Tanner, Bergwik, Bhongir, Pan, Dong, Wallner, Kalder&#233;n, Helleday, Boldogh, Adner and Egesten.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

The toxicity was assessed by acute toxicity and micronucleus tests in mice. The <i>in vivo</i> antitumor effect of ACS-AZ (12.5, 25, or 50&#160;mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) was determined using the Ehrlich tumor model, and toxicity. The antinociceptive efficacy of the compound (50&#160;mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated using formalin and hot plate assays in mice. The role of the opioid system was also investigated. In the acute toxicity test, the LD<sub>50</sub> (lethal dose 50%) value was 500&#160;mg/kg (i.p.), and no detectable genotoxic effect was observed. After a 7-day treatment, ACS-AZ significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) reduced tumor cell viability and peritumoral microvessels density, suggesting antiangiogenic action. In addition, ACS-AZ reduced (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) IL-1&#946; and CCL-2 levels, which may be related to the antiangiogenic effect, while increasing (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) TNF-&#945; and IL-4 levels, which are related to its direct cytotoxicity. ACS-AZ also decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) levels, both of which are crucial mediators in cancer known for their angiogenic action. Moreover, weak toxicological effects were recorded after a 7-day treatment (biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters). Concerning antinociceptive activity, ACS-AZ was effective on hotplate and formalin (early and late phases) tests (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), characteristic of analgesic agents with central action. Through pretreatment with the non-selective (naloxone) and &#956;1-selective (naloxonazine) opioid antagonists, we observed that the antinociceptive effect of ACS-AZ is mediated mainly by &#956;1-opioid receptors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

Thus, the present retrospective single-center study was performed to evaluate the expression of HER2 in UCB and its prognostic significance. The HER2 status of 108 patients with UCB who underwent radical cystectomy was assessed using immunohistochemistry, and its association with the recurrence and survival rates of patients was analyzed. HER2 overexpression was observed in 57.4% of the patients; this was significantly associated with higher tumor grades (P=0.006) and stages (P&lt;0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that patients with HER2 overexpression had a shorter 5-year overall survival rate (P=0.005) and recurrence-free survival rate (P=0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that HER2 overexpression was a high-risk independent predictor of UCB recurrence (hazard ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-12.18; P=0.039). On the whole, these findings demonstrate that evaluating the HER2 status may improve the prediction of cancer recurrence and may thus guide the selection of patients that will benefit the most from HER2-ADC therapies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright: &#169; Bai et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

The culture from the pus grew Mycobacterium abscessus. She required removal of the port and wound debridement, wound dressings and a prolonged course of antibiotics. Mycobacterium abscessus is a group of rapidly growing, multidrug-resistant, non-tuberculous mycobacteria that are also relatively resistant to standard skin disinfectants. In recent years, this organism has been increasingly reported as the culprit in post-operative or post-procedural infections. Treatment is challenging due to multidrug resistance, and requires an extensive course of intravenous antimicrobial and macrolide-based combination therapy followed by oral antimicrobial therapy. Early treatment is essential as progression may result in disseminated infection. We discuss the peri-operative and post-operative care required in preventing and treating infection with this organism.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright Journal of Radiology Case Reports.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Although the PARPi Olaparib is limited to treating cancer patients with DNA repair deficiencies, the PARPi Niraparib is FDA approved to treat ovarian cancer patients regardless of their status in DNA repair pathways. Despite differences in the affinity to PARP enzymes, the rationale behind the clinical use of Niraparib in patients without DNA repair deficiencies is still lacking. Moreover, only Olaparib has been approved for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with BRCA mutations, accounting for only 5-7% of total PDACs. It remains unclear whether Niraparib could be beneficial to PDACs without BRCA mutations. We found that Niraparib inhibits ovarian and PDAC tumor cell growth, regardless of BRCA mutational status, more effectively than Olaparib. Unlike Olaparib, which is known to activate STAT3, Niraparib inhibits STAT3 activity in ovarian and PDAC cancer cell lines and patient tumors. Moreover, Niraparib regulates the expression of several STAT3 downstream genes involved in apoptosis. Overexpression of a constitutively activated STAT3 mutant rescues Niraparib-induced cancer cell apoptosis. Our results suggest that Niraparib inhibits pSTAT3 by interfering with SRC tyrosine kinase.

Surveillance is fully included in patient's management, particularly during the first years of follow-up. Surveillance guidelines differ between the academic societies, mainly concerning imaging frequency and long-term follow-up. We evaluated surveillance practice and schedules followed by French specialists and set up a DELPHI method to obtain a consensual surveillance program with an optimal schedule for patients with localized TGCT. First, an online survey on surveillance practice of stage-I TGCT based on clinical-cases was conducted among urologists, radiation-oncologists and medical-oncologists. These results were compared to ESMO/EAU and AFU guidelines. Then a panel of experts assessed surveillance proposals following a Delphi-CM. Statements were drafted after analysis of the previous survey and systematic literature review, with 2 successive rounds to reach a consensus. The study was conducted between July 2018 and May 2019. Concerning the first step: 61 participated to the survey (69% medical-oncologists, 15% urologists, 16% radiation-oncologists). About 65% of practitioners followed clinico-biological guidelines concerning 1 to 5 years of follow-up, but only 25% stopped surveillance after the 5th-year. No physician followed the EAU/ESMO guidelines of de-escalation chest imaging. Concerning the second step: 32 experts (78% medical-oncologists, 16% urologists, 6% radiation-oncologists) participated to the Delphi-CM. Thanks to Delphi-CM, a consensus was reached for 26 of the 38 statements. Experts agreed on clinico-biological surveillance modalities and end of surveillance after the 5th-year of follow-up. For seminoma, abdominal ultrasound was proposed as an option to the abdominopelvic (AP) scan for the 4th-year of follow-up. No consensus was reached regarding de-escalation of chest imaging. To conclude, the survey proved that French TGCT-specialists do not follow current guidelines. With Delphi-CM, a consensus was obtained for frequency of clinico-biological surveillance, discontinuation of surveillance after the 5th-year, stop of AP scan on the 4th-year of follow-up for seminoma. Questions remains concerning type and frequency of chest imaging.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Da Silva, Fl&#233;chon, Coquan, Planchamp, Culine, Murez, M&#233;jean, Pasquier, Chevreau, Fizazi, Thiery-Vuilemin and Joly.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

However, the extremum expression of some histone modification genes (HMGs) in intestinal metaplasia (IM) rather than GC obscures the roles of HMGs in ICS. In this study, we assumed an explanation that the roles of HMGs in ICS were stage specific. Bulk RNA-seq on endoscopy biopsy samples from a total of 50 patients was accompanied by reanalysis of a set of published single-cell transcriptomes, which cross-sectionally profiled the transcriptomic features of chronic superficial gastritis (SG), atrophy gastritis (AG), IM, and early gastric cancer (GC). Differential analysis observed significantly peaked expression of <i>SIRT6</i> and <i>SIRT7</i> at IM. Weighted correlation network analysis on bulk transcriptome recognized significant correlations between <i>SIRT1/6</i> and IM. The single-cell atlas identified one subgroup of B cells expressing high level of <i>TFF1</i> (<i>TFF1</i> <sup>hi</sup> naive B cell) that theoretically played important roles in defending microbial infection, while <i>SIRT6</i> displayed a positive correlation with <i>TFF1</i> <sup>low</sup> naive B cells. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis at different lesions (SG-AG, AG-IM, and IM-GC) highlighted that gene sets contributing to IM, e.g., Brush Border, were largely enriched from co-expressing genes of Sirtuins (SIRTs) in AG-IM. Surveys of the genes negatively correlated with <i>SIRT6</i> in public databases considered <i>SIRT6</i> as tumor suppressors, which was confirmed by the cell proliferation and migration assays after transient transfection of <i>SIRT6</i> overexpression vector into AGS cells. All the above observations were then confirmed by serial section-based immunohistochemistry against Ki-67, MUC2, MUC5AC, p53, and SIRT6 on the endoscopic submucosal dissection tissue. By contrast, the expression of the other HMGs varied even opposite within same family. Taken together, this study preliminarily demonstrated the two-edged sword role of SIRTs in ICS and, by extension, showed that the roles of HMGs in ICS were probably stage specific. Our study may provide new insights into and attract attention on gastric prevention and therapy targeting HMGs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Wang, Bi, Li, Lu, Gao, Huang, Liu and Wang.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>Cancer therapy failure is a fundamental challenge in cancer treatment. One of the most common reasons for therapy failure is the development of acquired resistance of cancer cells. DNA-damaging agents are frequently used in first-line chemotherapy regimens and DNA damage response, and DNA repair pathways are significantly involved in the mechanisms of chemoresistance. MRE11, a part of the MRN complex involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, is connected to colorectal cancer (CRC) patients' prognosis. Our previous results showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) microRNA (miRNA) binding sites of <i>MRE11</i> gene are associated with decreased cancer risk but with shorter survival of CRC patients, which implies the role of miRNA regulation in CRC. The therapy of colorectal cancer utilizes oxaliplatin (oxalato(trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum), which is often compromised by chemoresistance development. There is, therefore, a crucial clinical need to understand the cellular processes associated with drug resistance and improve treatment responses by applying efficient combination therapies. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNAs on the oxaliplatin therapy response of CRC patients. By the <i>in silico</i> analysis, miR-140 was predicted to target MRE11 and modulate CRC prognosis. The lower expression of miR-140 was associated with the metastatic phenotype (p &lt; 0.05) and poor progression-free survival (odds ratio (OR) = 0.4, p &lt; 0.05). In the <i>in vitro</i> analysis, we used miRNA mimics to increase the level of miR-140 in the CRC cell line. This resulted in decreased proliferation of CRC cells (p &lt; 0.05). Increased levels of miR-140 also led to increased sensitivity of cancer cells to oxaliplatin (p &lt; 0.05) and to the accumulation of DNA damage. Our results, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, suggest that miR-140 may act as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in DSB DNA repair and, consequently, CRC therapy response.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Horak, Dolnikova, Cumaogullari, Cumova, Navvabi, Vodickova, Levy, Schneiderova, Liska, Andera, Vodicka and Opattova.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Patient samples were randomly assigned to the training or testing set in a 3:2 ratio. A novel lipid metabolism-related five-lncRNA signature with prognostic value for CC was built through the univariate Cox regression, least absolute contraction and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and was further evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier methods. Relevant analyses were also applied to identify the independent clinicopathological factors. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted to investigate the biological functions and molecular pathways. Immune infiltration analysis was included to probe the relationship between lncRNA signature and cancer cell microenvironment. <b>Results:</b> The novel lipid metabolism-related five-lncRNA signature was confirmed to be predictive of overall survival (OS) in CC patients.

The natural history of disease progression ranges from 10 to 20 years. Hence, effective screening can help in the early detection and prevention of fatal complications. This study aims to (1) compare the sociodemographic characteristics of the women with malignant and premalignant lesions of the cervix, (2) collate the accuracy of visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) with Pap smear cervical cytology in the early detection of premalignant and malignant lesions of the cervix, and (3) standardize it with histopathology, a gold standard screening tool.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">This study was carried out in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Gajra Raja Medical College, Gwalior, India, from October 2020 to March 2021 including all the sexually active women of the reproductive age group and postmenopausal women attending the gynecology outpatient department and the indoor admitted patients. A total of 500 patients were included in the study. The women were subjected to a Pap smear followed by VIA. Punch biopsy was taken from the acetowhite regions and sent for histopathological examination. The women with abnormal cervical cytology results also underwent a biopsy and histopathological examination.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">On comparative analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of Pap smear cytology were found to be 89.5% and 65.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of VIA were found to be 94.7% and 88%, respectively. The overall accuracy of VIA testing (93.2%) is more significant than that of Pap smear (68%).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">According to our study, it is found that visual inspection with acetic acid is more diagnostically accurate than Pap smear cytology. Hence, VIA testing could be implemented as a primary screening tool with credence. Also, as learned from our study, the premalignant and malignant lesions are more common among elderly women living under a low socioeconomic status. Hence, these groups of women must be outreached and covered through effectively targeted screening programs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022, David et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Detailed insight into the radiation-induced changes in tumor microvasculature is crucial to maximize the efficacy of radiotherapy against breast cancer. Recent advances in imaging have enabled precise targeting of solid lesions. However, intratumoral heterogeneity makes treatment planning and monitoring more challenging. Conventional imaging cannot provide high-resolution observation and longitudinal monitoring of large-scale microvascular in response to radiotherapy directly in deep tissues. Herein, we report on an emerging non-invasive imaging assessment method of morphological and functional tumor microvasculature responses with high spatio-temporal resolution by means of optoacoustic imaging (OAI). <i>In vivo</i> imaging of 4T1 breast tumor response to a conventional fractionated radiotherapy at varying dose (14 &#215; 2&#160;Gy and 3 &#215; 8&#160;Gy) has been performed after 2&#160;weeks following treatment. Remarkably, optoacoustic images can generate richful contrast for the tumor microvascular architecture. Besides, the functional status of tumor microvasculature and tumor oxygenation levels were further estimated using OAI. The results revealed the differential (size-dependent) nature of vascular responses to radiation treatments at varying doses. The vessels exhibited an decrease in their density accompanied by a decline in the number of vascular segments following irradiation, compared to the control group. The measurements further revealed an increase of tumor oxygenation levels for 14 &#215; 2&#160;Gy and 3 &#215; 8&#160;Gy irradiations. Our results suggest that OAI could be used to assess the response to radiotherapy based on changes in the functional and morphological status of tumor microvasculature, which are closely linked to the intratumor microenvironment. OAI assessment of the tumor microenvironment such as oxygenation status has the potential to be applied to precise radiotherapy strategy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Wu, Xu, Xie, Shen, Fu, Liu, Chi, Lu, Xiang, Wen, Yang and Jiang.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>A leading theory for ovarian carcinogenesis proposes that inflammation associated with incessant ovulation is a driver of oncogenesis. Consistent with this theory, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert promising chemopreventive activity for ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, toxicity is associated with long-term use of NSAIDs due to their cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity. Previous studies suggest the antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs is COX independent, and rather may be exerted through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition. PDEs represent a unique chemopreventive target for ovarian cancer given that ovulation is regulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Here we evaluate PDE10A as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian tumors revealed PDE10A overexpression was associated with significantly worse overall survival for patients. PDE10A expression also positively correlated with the upregulation of oncogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Using small molecule inhibitors, Pf-2545920 and a novel NSAID-derived PDE10A inhibitor, MCI-030, we show that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased ovarian cancer cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate these pro-apoptotic properties occur through PKA and PKG signaling by using specific inhibitors to block their activity. PDE10A genetic knockout in ovarian cancer cells through CRISP/Cas9 editing lead to decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. We also demonstrate that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased Wnt-induced &#946;-catenin nuclear translocation, as well as decreased EGF-mediated activation of RAS/MAPK and AKT pathways in ovarian cancer cells. These findings implicate PDE10A as novel target for ovarian cancer chemoprevention and treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, the efficacy of these therapies is significantly limited by primary and acquired resistance, that relies not only on cell-autonomous mechanisms but also on tumor microenvironment cues. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are extremely plastic cells of the tumor microenvironment. They not only produce extracellular matrix components that build up the structure of tumor stroma, but they also release growth factors, chemokines, exosomes, and metabolites that affect all tumor properties, including response to drug treatment. The contribution of CAFs to tumor progression has been deeply investigated and reviewed in several works.

Scientists are also aware of the prospective advantages of CAR engineering in cellular immunotherapy. Due to various limitations such as the serious side effects of CAR-T therapy, researchers began to investigate other immune cells for CAR modification. Natural killer (NK) cells are critical innate immune cells with the characteristic of non-specifically recognizing target cells and with the potential to become \"off-the-shelf\" products. In recent years, many preclinical studies on CAR-engineered NK (CAR-NK) cells have shown their remarkable efficacy in cancer therapy and their superiority over autologous CAR-T cells. In this review, we summarize the generation, mechanisms of anti-tumor activity and unique advantages of CAR-NK cells, and then analyze some challenges and recent clinical trials about CAR-NK cells therapy. We believe that CAR-NK therapy is a promising prospect for cancer immunotherapy in the future.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, formal genetic testing could not be carried out for all patients due to extensive use of healthcare resources, which in turn results in high medical costs. To date, existing BRCA1/2 deleterious variants prediction models have been developed in women of European or other descent who are quite genetically different from Asian population.

All these elements operate with each other in a coordinated fashion and collectively promote cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Over the past few decades, numerous studies have been conducted to study the interaction and crosstalk between stromal components and neoplastic cells. Meanwhile, we have also witnessed an exponential increase in the investigation and recognition of the critical roles of tumor stroma in solid tumors. A series of clinical trials targeting the tumor stroma have been launched continually. In this review, we introduce and discuss current advances in the understanding of various stromal elements and their roles in cancers.

However, in ulcerative colitis (UC), the potential value of robotic proctectomy has not yet been investigated, and in this indication, the operation needs to be adjusted to the total colectomy typically performed in the preceding 6&#160;months. In this study, we describe the technique and analyze outcomes of a staged laparoscopic and robotic three-stage restorative proctocolectomy and compare the clinical outcome with the classical laparoscopic procedure. Between December 2016 and May 2021, 17 patients underwent robotic completion proctectomy (CP) with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for UC. These patients were compared to 10 patients who underwent laparoscopic CP and IPAA, following laparoscopic total colectomy with end ileostomy 6&#160;months prior by the same surgical team at our tertiary referral center. 27 patients underwent a 3-stage procedure for refractory UC (10 in the lap. group vs. 17 in the robot group). Return to normal bowel function and morbidity were comparable between the two groups. Median length of hospital stay was the same for the robotic proctectomy/IPAA group with 7&#160;days [median; IQR (6-10)], compared to the laparoscopic stage II with 7.5&#160;days [median; IQR (6.25-8)]. Median time to soft diet was 2&#160;days [IQR (1-3)] vs. 3&#160;days in the lap group [IQR 3&#160;(3-4)]. Two patients suffered from a major complication (Clavien-Dindo&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;3a) in the first 90 postoperative days in the robotic group vs. one in the laparoscopic group. Perception of cosmetic results were favorable with 100% of patients reporting to be highly satisfied or satisfied in the robotic group. This report demonstrates the feasibility of a combined laparoscopic and robotic staged restorative proctocolectomy for UC, when compared with the traditional approach. Robotic pelvic dissection and a revised trocar placement in staged proctocolectomy with synergistic use of both surgical techniques with their individual advantages will likely improve overall long-term functional results, including an improved cosmetic outcome.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

As this occurs, training will need to be adapted to include strategies to train across various consoles. These new consoles differ in multiple ways, with some new vendors using flat screen open source 3D enhanced vision with glasses and differences in design will require surgeons to learn new skills. This process has parallels with aviation credentialling across different aircraft described as type rating. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that technical robotic console operating skills are transferrable across different robotic operating platforms. Ten participants sequentially completed four Mimic<sup>&#174;</sup>(Surgical Science) simulation exercises on two different robotic operating platforms (DaVinci<sup>&#174;</sup>, Intuitive Surgical and HUGO&#8482; RAS, Medtronic). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Groups were balanced for key demographics including previous robotic simulator experience. Data for simulation metrics and time to proficiency were collected for each attempt at the simulated exercise and analysed. Qualitative feedback on multi-platform learning was sought via unstructured interviews and a questionnaire. Participants were divided into two groups of 5. Group 1 completed the simulation exercises on console A first then repeated these exercises on console B. Group 2 completed the simulated exercises on console B first then repeated these exercises on console A. Group 1 candidates adapted quicker to the second console and Group 2 candidates reached proficiency faster on the first console. Participants were slower on the second attempt of the final exercise regardless of their allocated group. Quality and efficiency metrics and risk and safety metrics were equivalent across consoles. The data from this investigation suggests that console operating skills are transferrable across different platforms. Overall risk and safety metrics are within acceptable limits regardless of the order of progression of console indicating that training can safely occur across multiple consoles contemporaneously. This data has implications for the design of training and certification as new platforms progress to market and supports a proficiency-based approach.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Antioxidants such as triterpenoids have exhibited anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials to alleviate skin carcinogenesis. This study investigated the methylome and transcriptome altered by tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or TPA with 2-cyano 2,3-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO). The results show that CDDO blocks TPA-induced transformation dose dependently. Several differential expressed genes (DEGs) involved in skin cell transformation, while counteracted by CDDO, were revealed by differential expression analysis including Lyl1, Lad1, and Dennd2d. In CpG methylomic profiles, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the promoter region altered by TPA while showing the opposite methylation status in the CDDO treatment group were identified. The correlation between DNA methylation and RNA expression has been established and DMRs showing inverse correlation were further studied as potential therapeutic targets. From the CpG methylome and transcriptome results, CDDO significantly restored gene expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) inhibited by TPA by decreasing their promoter CpG methylation. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) shows that CDDO neutralized the effect of TPA through modulating cell cycles, cell migration, and inflammatory and immune response regulatory pathways. Notably, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 (TNFR2) signaling was significantly downregulated by CDDO potentially contributing to prevention of TPA-induced cell transformation. Overall, incorporating the transcriptome, CpG methylome, and signaling pathway network, we reveal potential therapeutic targets and pathways by which CDDO could reverse TPA-induced carcinogenesis. The results could be useful for future human study and targets development for skin cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, has emerged as a hallmark of cancer and is associated with tumor progression and unfavorable clinical outcomes in cancer patients. PP2A is a highly conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of human cancers. However, the relationship between PP2A and the Warburg effect in gastric cancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the expression profile of two endogenous inhibitors of PP2A, SET and CIP2A, in gastric cancer, were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were performed to investigate the roles of PP2A in gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis. Cell biological, molecular, and biochemical approaches were employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that SET and CIP2A were overexpressed in gastric cancer and associated with a decreased PP2A activity. Pharmacological activation of PP2A with FTY-720 and DT-061 in two gastric cancer cell lines significantly reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolytic ability. Importantly, inhibition of PP2A activity by genetic silencing of PPP2R5A resulted in a growth advantage, which can be largely compromised by the addition of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, suggesting a glycolysis-dependent effect of PP2A in gastric cancer. Mechanistically, the well-known transcription factor and glycolysis regulator c-Myc was discovered as the functional mediator of PP2A in regulating cell glycolysis. Ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-mutant c-Myc resistant to PP2A (MycT58A) restored the inhibitory effect of FTY-720 and DT-061 on lactate production and glucose uptake. Furthermore, there was a close association between SET and CIP2A expression and c-Myc gene signatures in gastric cancer samples. Collectively, this study provides strong evidence of the involvement of PP2A in the Warburg effect and indicates that it could be a novel antitumor strategy to target tumor metabolism in gastric cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a central role in cellular homeostasis and is often dysregulated in cancer. The increased expression of PI3K protein in the literature is associated with a poor prognosis, and alterations in the PIK3CA gene can lead to changes in downstream pathways. Thus, the objective of this study was to validate the protein expression to confirm the gene expression of proteins belonging to the main pathway PI3K and PTEN, and their downstream pathways through ZEB1, ZEB2, HIF1A, VHL, CASP3 and PARP1 relating to prognosis in canine mammary cancer. For protein studies, the samples came from 58 female dogs with mammary neoplasia, immunohistochemistry was performed and its analysis by the histoscore method. For the genetic evaluation, the samples came from 13 patients, the DNA was extracted and the analysis for quantitative expression. Through immunohistochemistry, PI3K positivity was significantly associated with affected regional lymph node, distant metastasis, patients with HER2+, Triple Negative and Luminal B phenotypes, and the lowest survival rates. Through gene expression, we observed higher gene expression of ZEB2 and PARP1 both among patients who were alive and who died, which was not true for the expressions of PIK3CA and HIF1A. In conclusion, the data observed in this work are promising in the study of new molecular prognostic markers such as PI3K, ZEB2 and PARP1 for canine mammary cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The current study aims to examine the potential biological functions of gastric cancer (GC) cell-released exosomes delivering a novel circRNA circ_0091741 in GC and the underlying molecular mechanism. Expression of circ_0091741 was examined in the GC cells, (OXA)-resistant HGC-27 (HGC-27/OXA) cells, and isolated exosomes, after which its downstream miRNA was analyzed. The role and mechanism of the circ_0091741 transmitted by GC cells-derived exosomes in GC cell autophagy and chemoresistance were assessed using various molecular biological methods. A mouse tumor xenograft model was prepared to discern the effect of circ_0091741 on tumorigenesis in vivo. GC cells and their exosomes were characterized by upregulated circ_0091741 expression. circ_0091741 transferred by GC cell-derived exosomes induced the autophagy and OXA resistance of GC cells. circ_0091741 obstructed the binding of miR-330-3p to TRIM14 and increased the expression of TRIM14. TRIM14 could cause activation of the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway by stabilizing Dvl2. By this mechanism, the autophagy and OXA resistance of GC cells were augmented. In vivo assay unfolded that orthotopic implantation of exosomal circ_0091741 overexpressed GC cells into nude mice enhanced tumorigenesis. In conclusion, our study emphasized the promotive role of exosomal circ_0091741 in autophagy and chemoresistance of GC cells, thus laying the basis for the development of novel therapeutic targets for GC treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

However, for functionally annotating the thousands of cancer-associated missense mutations, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS), purifying variant proteins for biochemical and functional analysis is cost-prohibitive and inefficient. We describe parallel functional annotation (PFA) of large numbers of VUS using small cultures and crude extracts in 96-well plates. Using members of a histone methyltransferase family, we demonstrate high-throughput structural and functional annotation of cancer-associated mutations. By combining functional annotation of paralogs, we discovered two phylogenetic and clustering parameters that improve the accuracy of sequence-based functional predictions to over 90%. Our results demonstrate the value of PFA for defining oncogenic/tumor suppressor functions of histone methyltransferases as well as enhancing the accuracy of sequence-based algorithms in predicting the effects of cancer-associated mutations.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database indicated a negative correlation between miR-874 and PMVK expression and between miR-874 and SREBF2 expression.

We confirmed that prodigiosin played an anticancer role in several GBM cell lines through the KIAA1524/PP2A/Akt signalling pathway. Prodigiosin inhibited the protein expression of KIAA1524 by suppressing its transcription, which led to activation of PP2A. Afterward, PP2A inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby inducing increased expression of p53/p21. Furthermore, it was verified that prodigiosin inhibited the KIAA1524/PP2A/Akt axis in vivo in the LN229 xenograft model.

However, its influence on cancer biology and the mechanism by which cells sense and respond to changes in viscosity are unknown. Here we demonstrate that elevated viscosity counterintuitively increases the motility of various cell types on two-dimensional surfaces and in confinement, and increases cell dissemination from three-dimensional tumour spheroids. Increased mechanical loading imposed by elevated viscosity induces an actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-complex-dependent dense actin network, which enhances Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1 (NHE1) polarization through its actin-binding partner ezrin. NHE1 promotes cell swelling and increased membrane tension, which, in turn, activates transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and mediates calcium influx, leading to increased RHOA-dependent cell contractility. The coordinated action of actin remodelling/dynamics, NHE1-mediated swelling and RHOA-based contractility facilitates enhanced motility at elevated viscosities. Breast cancer cells pre-exposed to elevated viscosity acquire TRPV4-dependent mechanical memory through transcriptional control of the Hippo pathway, leading to increased migration in zebrafish, extravasation in chick embryos and lung colonization in mice.

Genetic ablation of the TRPV1 lineage, local pharmacological silencing of nociceptors and antagonism of the CGRP receptor RAMP1 all reduced the exhaustion of tumour-infiltrating leukocytes and decreased the growth of tumours, nearly tripling the survival rate of mice that were inoculated with B16F10 melanoma cells.

The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic value of the EU-TIRADS score in Congolese hospitals, using pathological examination after surgery as the gold standard in Congolese hospitals. This retrospective and analytical study examined clinical, ultrasound and pathological data of 549 patients aged 45&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14&#160;years, including 468 females (85.2%), operated for thyroid nodule between January 2005 and January 2019.

At this time, the only FDA-approved therapeutic for COVID-19 is remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analog. Efficacy is only moderate, and improved treatment strategies are urgently needed. To accomplish this goal, we devised a strategy to identify compounds that act synergistically with remdesivir in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conducted combinatorial high-throughput screening in the presence of submaximal remdesivir concentrations, using a human lung epithelial cell line infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. This identified 20 approved drugs that act synergistically with remdesivir, many with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Strongest effects were observed with established antivirals, Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (HCV NS5A) inhibitors velpatasvir and elbasvir. Combination with their partner drugs sofosbuvir and grazoprevir further increased efficacy, increasing remdesivir's apparent potency&#8201;&gt;&#8201;25-fold. We report that HCV NS5A inhibitors act on the SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease proofreader, providing a possible explanation for the synergy observed with nucleoside analog remdesivir. FDA-approved Hepatitis C therapeutics Epclusa&#174; (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Zepatier&#174; (elbasvir/grazoprevir) could be further optimized to achieve potency and pharmacokinetic properties that support clinical evaluation&#160;in combination with&#160;remdesivir.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

A total of 167 patients who received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer treatment from January 2010 to August 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in the patient groups stratified by prostate volume and the amount of testosterone reduction were assessed every 4&#160;weeks until 12&#160;weeks after androgen deprivation therapy initiation. Longitudinal mixed models were used to assess the adjusted effects of prostate volume and testosterone reduction on IPSS change. All mean values of IPSS-total score (IPSS-total), voiding subscore (IPSS-vs), and storage subscore (IPSS-ss) significantly decreased from baseline to week&#160;12 in both patients with small (&lt;&#8201;33&#160;mL) and large (&#8805;&#8201;33&#160;mL) prostates. The mean values of IPSS-total, IPSS-vs, and IPSS-ss similarly decreased in patients with large prostate with a baseline IPSS-total of&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;13. However, in those with small prostate, IPSS-ss specifically remained unchanged, while IPSS-total and IPSS-vs significantly decreased. In addition, only in patients with small prostate (&lt;&#8201;33&#160;mL), patients with lesser testosterone reduction (&lt;&#8201;&#916;400&#160;ng/dL) showed greater improvement in IPSS-ss by 7.5% compared with those with greater testosterone reduction (&#8805;&#8201;&#916;400&#160;ng/dL). In conclusion, although androgen deprivation therapy generally improves lower urinary tract symptoms, it may worsen specifically storage symptoms in patients with relatively small prostate and greater testosterone reduction. Our finding suggests that testosterone may influence lower urinary tract symptoms in these patients.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

To better understand potential mechanisms behind the observed variation in plumage colouration, we shifted our attention from a high-level expression of colour to low-level physiological phenomena by targeting the microstructure and pigment content of the feather. In a well-studied model system, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), we combined an experimental manipulation of birds\\' physiological condition and availability of resources that are key to the production of the studied colouration (phenylalanine and tyrosine (PT). We found that feathers from sparrows fed with the control diet had noticeably lower values of brightness, suggesting a higher quality of the ornamental \"blackness\" in comparison to those sampled from birds fed with a PT-reduced diet. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy detected higher melanin concentrations in samples from the control than the PT-reduced group. Our multi-level analysis excluded mechanisms such as barbule density and melanosomes\\' distribution, clearly pointing to the finest-level proxy of colour: the concentration of melanin in melanosomes themselves. Despite melanins being manufactured by birds endogenously, the efficiency of melanogenesis can be noticeably limited by diet. As a result, the birds\\' plumage colouration is affected, which may entail consequences in social signalling.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

One is RhoA, an MM mutation-susceptible locus-derived protein, and another is vigilin, a lung small cell carcinoma marker. IHC was performed using 93 MM (epithelioid, 71 cases; sarcomatoid, 13 cases; and biphasic, 9 cases), 64 lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), 60 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSC), and 14 normal mesothelial (NM) tissues. The majority of epithelioid MM cases were positive for both RhoA and vigilin, whereas both IHCs showed lower stainability in biphasic and sarcomatoid MM. Besides, both IHCs showed significantly higher stainability for RhoA and vigilin in epithelioid MM than in LAC and LSC (p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Chi-square tests showed that both RhoA and vigilin IHC positive rate in epithelioid MM was not significantly different from that of calretinin (p&#8201;&gt;&#8201;0.05). In the differential diagnosis of MM from lung cancer, the accuracy and specificity of RhoA, vigilin, and calretinin staining were almost equivalent.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade against inhibitory receptors such as receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), has revolutionized cancer treatment. Effective immune reactivity against tumour antigens requires the infiltration and activation of tumour-infiltrating T-cells (TILs). In this context, ligation of the antigen-receptor complex (TCR) in combination with the co-receptor CD28 activates the intracellular mediator AKT (or PKB, protein kinase B) and its downstream targets. PD-1 inhibits the activation of AKT/PKB. Given this, we assessed whether the direct activation of AKT might be effective in activating the immune system to limit the growth of tumors that are resistant to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We found that the small molecule activator of AKT (SC79) limited growth of a B16 tumor and an EMT-6 syngeneic breast tumor model that are poorly responsive to PD-1 immunotherapy. In the case of B16 tumors, direct AKT activation induced (i) a reduction of suppressor regulatory (Treg) TILs and (ii) an increase in effector CD8+ TILs. SC79 in vivo therapy caused a major increase in the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs to express&#160;interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;). This effect on IFN-&#947; expression distinguished responsive from non-responsive anti-tumor responses and could be recapitulated ex vivo with human T-cells. In CD4+FoxP3+Treg TILs, AKT induced IFN-&#947; expression was accompanied by a loss of suppressor activity, the conversation to CD4<sup>+</sup> helper Th1-like TILs and a marked reduction in phospho-SHP2. In CD8+ TILs, we observed an increase in the phospho-activation of PLC-&#947;. Further, the genetic deletion of the transcription factor T-bet (Tbx21) blocked the increased IFN-&#947; expression on all subsets while ablating the therapeutic benefits of SC79 on tumor growth. Our study shows that AKT activation therapy acts to induce IFN-&#947; on CD4 and CD8 TILs that is accompanied by the intra-tumoral conversation of suppressive Tregs into CD4<sup>+</sup>Th1-like T-cells and augmented CD8 responses.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The possibility of using protein expression on circulating T-lymphocytes as a biomarker to discriminate early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored. Four independent PBMC gene expression microarray datasets (GSE12771, GSE13255, GSE20189 and GSE3934) were analyzed. We selected C5AR1, CLEC4A and NLRP3 based on their significant protein expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, but not in normal lymphoid tissue. A validation study using automated flow cytometry was conducted in 141 study participants including 76 treatment-naive early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC), 12 individuals with non-malignant pulmonary diseases, and 53 healthy individuals. Median ratios of C5AR1, CLEC4A and NLRP3 specific antibody staining to CD3 positive cells in early-stage NSCLC patients compared to healthy controls were 0.014 [0-0.37] vs. 0.01 [0-0.07, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.13], 0.03 [0-0.87] vs. 0.02 [0-0.13, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.10] and 0.19 [0-0.60] vs. 0.09 [0.02-0.31, p&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001], respectively.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an excellent resource for biomarker discovery because of its high copy number and increased mutational frequency in cancer cells. We examined if mtDNA mutations can be detected in circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) of PDAC patients and used for discerning between cancer and non-cancer subjects. A greater yield of circulating EVs (~&#8201;1.4 fold; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.002) was obtained in PDAC patients (n&#8201;=&#8201;20) than non-cancer (NC) individuals (n&#8201;=&#8201;10).

PDAC-EVs also had higher levels of cardiolipin (a mitochondrial inner-membrane phospholipid), suggestive of their mitochondrial origin. All mtDNA mutations in PDAC-EVs were unique and frequency was remarkably higher. Most mtDNA mutations (41.5%) in PDAC-EVs were in the respiratory complex-I (RCI) (ND1-ND6), followed by the RCIII gene (CYTB; 11.2%). Among the non-coding genes, D-Loop and RNR2 exhibited the most mutations (15.2% each).

For RiA, PCa cells labeled by antibody-conjugated Raman probe were detected by Raman spectrometer. TGiA and RiA were first optimized by the detection of PCa cultured cells (DU145) spiked into control urine, with TGiA-OSAM showing single-cell PCa detection sensitivity, while RiA had a limit of detection of 4-10 cells/mL. Blinded analysis of each patient urine sample, using MIL-38 antibody specific for PCa cells, was performed using both assays in parallel with control urine. Both assays detected very low abundance PCa cells in patient urine (3-20 PCa cells per mL by TGiA, 4-13 cells/mL by RiA). The normalized mean of the detected PCa cells per 1&#160;ml of urine was plotted against the clinical data including prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and Clinical Risk Assessment for each patient. Both cell detection assays showed correlation with PSA in the high risk patients but aligned with the Clinical Assessment rather than with PSA levels of the low/intermediate risk patients.

The Venetin-1 nanoparticle was obtained after thermal treatment of the coelomic fluid, separation from coelomocytes, filtration, and lyophilization. The preparation showed a selective effect on cancer cells, whereas normal cells were unaffected. Venetin-1 was effective against the lung cancer cells at doses of 31.3 and 62.5&#160;&#181;g/ml, and the results were imaged using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cells died mainly via the apoptosis pathway. Necrotic cells appeared sporadically in the microscopic view.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed changes in the topography, peak force error images, and Young's modulus (elasticity) of the A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The transmission electron cryomicroscopy (Cryo-TEM) analysis indicated a polymeric nature of the analyzed preparation. The samples of Venetin-1 showed a very homogeneous size profile with the microparticle size of approximately 58.23&#160;nm. A significant decrease in Venetin-1 binding to sphingomyelin was observed. Venetin-1 lost its pore-forming activity or deactivation of the pore-forming activity occurred. This confirms the absence of hemolytic capacity of Venetin-1 towards red blood cells.

We carried out Raman analysis and mass spectrometry of plasma and saliva from more than 50 subjects in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients and benign controls (e.g., patients with benign oral masses). Unsupervised data models were built to assess diagnostic performance. Raman spectra collected from either biofluid provided moderate performance to discriminate cancer samples. However, by fusing together the Raman spectra of plasma and saliva for each patient, subsequent analytical models delivered an impressive sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.3%, 85.7%, and 91.7%, respectively. We further confirmed that the metabolites driving the differences in Raman spectra for our models are among the same ones that drive mass spectrometry models, unifying the two techniques and validating the underlying ability of Raman to assess metabolite composition. This study bolsters the relevance of Raman to provide additive value by probing the unique chemical compositions across biofluid sources. Ultimately, we show that a simple data augmentation routine of fusing plasma and saliva spectra provided significantly higher clinical value than either biofluid alone, pushing forward the potential of clinical translation of Raman spectroscopy for liquid biopsy cancer diagnostics.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the effect of lncRNAs on cancer patient prognosis, including overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Collectively, 23 lncRNAs in 11 cancer types were enrolled. Of them, 13 lncRNAs were downregulated and related to radiosensitivity, 11 lncRNAs were upregulated and related to radioresistance, and 3 lncRNAs were upregulated and related to radiosensitivity in cancers. Furthermore, 17 microRNAs and 20 pathways were targeted by different lncRNAs and contributed to the cancer radiotherapy response in this meta-analysis. The individual pooled HRs (95% CIs) of downregulated radiation-resistant and upregulated radiation-resistant lncRNAs for OS were 0.49 (0.40-0.60) and 1.88 (1.26-2.79), respectively.

To define the biologic basis for and clinical significance of this morphologic heterogeneity, here we perform integrated genomic analyses of mixed histology bladder cancers with separable regions of urothelial and squamous differentiation. We find that squamous differentiation is a marker of intratumoral genomic and immunologic heterogeneity in patients with bladder cancer and a biomarker of intrinsic immunotherapy resistance. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that in all cases the urothelial and squamous regions are derived from a common shared precursor. Despite the presence of marked genomic heterogeneity between co-existent urothelial and squamous differentiated regions, no recurrent genomic alteration exclusive to the urothelial or squamous morphologies is identified. Rather, lineage plasticity in bladder cancers with squamous differentiation is associated with loss of expression of FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG, transcription factors critical for maintenance of urothelial cell identity. Of clinical significance, lineage plasticity and PD-L1 expression is coordinately dysregulated via FOXA1, with patients exhibiting morphologic heterogeneity pre-treatment significantly less likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

Animal studies show that mice loss of LXN promotes tumor growth in subcutaneous tumor model and AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer model. We found that loss of LXN promotes macrophage M2 polarization and PD-L2 expression in macrophage, thus, inhibits the function of T cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophage rescues the function of T cells in LXN-deficient mice. LXN deficiency in hematopoietic lineage exacerbates colorectal carcinogenesis, and targeted inhibition of PD-L2 ameliorates cancer growth in LXN-deficient mice.

LXN deficiency enhances PD-L2 expression rather than PD-L1 in macrophages, which lead to inhibition of T cells in tumor microenvironment.

Mechanistically, MLL4 ablation attenuates the expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and DNA methyltransferases through decommissioning enhancers/super-enhancers, which consequently lead to transcriptional reactivation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-interferon response and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis, respectively.

Here we show a strong correlation between MYC expression and loss of immune signatures in human TNBC. In mouse models of TNBC proficient or deficient of breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene (BRCA1), MYC overexpression dramatically decreases lymphocyte infiltration in tumors, along with immune signature remodelling. MYC-mediated suppression of inflammatory signalling induced by BRCA1/2 inactivation is confirmed in human TNBC cell lines. Moreover, MYC overexpression prevents the recruitment and activation of lymphocytes in both human and mouse TNBC co-culture models. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing reveals that MYC, together with its co-repressor MIZ1, directly binds promoters of multiple interferon-signalling genes, resulting in their downregulation. MYC overexpression thus counters tumor growth inhibition by a Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) agonist via suppressing induction of interferon signalling. Together, our data reveal that MYC suppresses innate immunity and facilitates tumor immune escape, explaining the poor immunogenicity of MYC-overexpressing TNBCs.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

HMCD analogues with strongly ionisable sulphonic acid groups were not taken up by patient derived GBM cells, but were taken up by the U87MG cell line. HMCD uptake relies on a combination of transporter uptake through organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and endocytosis into GBM cells. The uptake of HMCDs was not affected by p-glycoprotein efflux in GBM cells. Finally, we demonstrate structure-dependent cytotoxic activity at high concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> ; 1-100 &#956;M), likely due to mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis.

Tumorigenesis in TNBC is caused due to the mutation or overexpression of tumor suppressor genes. It is also associated with mutations in the BRCA gene which is linked to hereditary breast cancer. In addition, PARP proteins and checkpoint proteins also play a crucial function in causing TNBC. Many cell signaling pathways are dysregulated in TNBC. Even though chemotherapy and immunotherapy are good options for TNBC treatment, the response rates are still low in general. Many phytochemicals that are derived from natural compounds have shown very good inhibitions for TNBC. Natural compounds have the great advantage of being less toxic, having lesser side effects, and being easily available.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>ConspectusThe advent of photochemical techniques has revolutionized the landscape of biology and medical sciences. Especially appealing in this context is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is a photon-initiated treatment modality that uses cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill malignant cells. In the past decade, PDT has risen to the forefront of cancer therapy. Its optical control enables noninvasive and spatiotemporal manipulation of the treatment process, and its photoactive nature allows unique patterns to avoid drug resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. However, despite the impressive advances in this field, achieving widespread clinical adoption of PDT remains difficult. A major concern is that in the hostile tumor microenvironment, tumor cells are hypoxic, which hinders ROS generation during PDT action. To overcome this \"Achilles\\' heel\", current strategies focus primarily on the improvement of the intratumoral O<sub>2</sub> perfusion, while clinical trials suggest that O<sub>2</sub> enrichment may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, thereby making FDA approval and clinical transformation of these paradigms challenging.In an effort to improve hypoxia photodynamic therapy (hPDT) in the clinic, we have explored \"low to no O<sub>2</sub>-dependent\" photochemical approaches over the years to combat hypoxia-induced resistance. In this Account, we present our contributions to this theme during the past 5 years, beginning with low O<sub>2</sub>-dependent approaches (e.g., type I superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;-</sup>) generator, photodynamic O<sub>2</sub>-economizer, mitochondrial respiration inhibition, cellular self-protective pathway modulation, etc.) and progressing to O<sub>2</sub>-independent strategies (e.g., autoadaptive PDT/PTT complementary therapy, O<sub>2</sub>-independent artificial photoredox catalysis in cells). These studies have attracted tremendous attention. Particularly in the pioneering work of 2018, we presented the first demonstration that the O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;-</sup>-mediated partial O<sub>2</sub>-recyclability mechanism can overcome PDT resistance ( <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> 2018, 140, 14851-14859). This launched an era of renewed interest in type I PDT, resulting in a plethora of new O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8226;-</sup> photogenerators developed by many groups around the world. Moreover, with the discovery of O<sub>2</sub>-independent photoredox reactions in living cells, artificial photoredox catalysis has emerged as a new field connecting photochemistry and biomedicine, stimulating the development of next-generation phototherapeutic tools ( <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc.</i> 2022, 144, 163-173). Our recent work also disclosed that \"photoredox catalysis in cells\" might be a general mechanism of action of PDT ( <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> 2022, 119, e2210504119). These emergent concepts, molecular designs, photochemical mechanisms, and applications in cancer diagnosis and therapeutics, as well as pros and cons, are discussed in depth in this Account. It is expected that our contributions to date will be of general use to researchers and inspire future efforts to identify more promising hPDT approaches that better meet the clinical needs of cancer therapy.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>In situ tumor vaccines (ITV) have been recognized as a promising antitumor strategy since they contain the entire tumor-specific antigens, avoiding tumor cells from evading immune surveillance due to antigen loss. However, the therapeutic benefits of ITV are limited by obstacles such as insufficient antigen loading, inadequate immune system activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME). Herein, a tumor microenvironment-activated hydrogel platform (TED-Gel) with programmed drug release property is constructed for cascaded amplification of the anti-tumor immune response elicited by ITV. Both doxorubicin (Dox) and cytosine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) are released first, in which Dox induces immunogenic tumor cell death causing additional tumor antigen release and leading the dying primary tumor cells into autologous tumor vaccine, and the released CpG promotes antigen presenting cell activation. Subsequently, the decomposed scaffold materials in conjunction with CpG, turn the anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages into the M1 type, reversing the immunosuppressive TME. With decomposition of the TED-Gel, large amounts of macromolecule anti-PD-L1 antibodies are liberated, reinvigorating the exhausted effector T cells. In vivo studies demonstrate that TED-Gel significantly inhibits the primary, distant and rechallenged tumor growth. Overall, the simple and powerful TED-Gel provides an alternative strategy for the future development of tumor vaccines with broad application.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Reasons for treatment failure are poorly understood. CARs simultaneously targeting two antigens may represent an alternative. Here, we (1) designed and characterized novel A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) based dual-antigen targeting CARs, and (2) investigated mechanisms of resistance to CAR T cells with three different BCMA-binding moieties (APRIL, single-chain-variable-fragment, heavy-chain-only).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">Three new APRIL-CARs were designed and characterized. Human APRIL-CAR T cells were evaluated for their cytotoxic function in vitro and in vivo, for their polyfunctionality, immune synapse formation, memory, exhaustion phenotype and tonic signaling activity. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed BCMA levels and cellular localization and quantified CAR T cell-target cell interactions by live microscopy. Impact on pathway activation and tumor cell proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">APRIL-CAR T cells in a trimeric ligand binding conformation conferred fast but not sustained antitumor responses in vivo in mouse xenograft models. In vitro trimer-BB&#950; CAR T cells were more polyfunctional and formed stronger immune synapses than monomer-BB&#950; CAR T cells. After CAR T cell-myeloma cell contact, BCMA was rapidly downmodulated on target cells with all evaluated binding moieties. CAR T cells acquired BCMA by trogocytosis, and BCMA on MM cells was rapidly internalized. Since BCMA can be re-expressed during progression and persisting CAR T cells may not protect patients from relapse, we investigated whether non-functional CAR T cells play a role in tumor progression. While CAR T cell-MM cell interactions activated BCMA pathway, we did not find enhanced tumor growth in vitro or in vivo.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Antitumor responses with APRIL-CAR T cells were fast but not sustained. Rapid BCMA downmodulation occurred independently of whether an APRIL or antibody-based binding moiety was used. BCMA internalization mostly contributed to this effect, but trogocytosis by CAR T cells was also observed. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying CAR T cell failure in MM when targeting BCMA and can inform the development of improved treatment strategies.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Other methods, such as next-generation short read sequencing or PCR assays, are limited in their capabilities to detect or characterize structural variants.

Fatigue-like behavior was assessed by measuring variations in voluntary wheel running using a longitudinal design. Treatment robustly decreased voluntary wheel running, and this effect persisted for more than a month posttreatment. However, when wheels were removed, to minimize treatment-related fatigue, mice showed a more rapid return to baseline running levels. We confirmed that the delayed recovery observed in mice with continual wheel access was not due to increased treatment-related toxicity, in fact running attenuated cisplatin-induced kidney toxicity. Finally, we demonstrated that re-exposure to a treatment-related olfactory cue acutely re-instated fatigue. These data provide the first demonstration that associative processes can modulate the persistence of cancer-related fatigue-like behavior.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The yield of most CRC screening programs, however, is based on AAs and CRC only. We assessed the ASP detection rate, and increase in positive predictive value (PPV) including ASPs in the yield of a FIT-based screening program. <u>Methods</u> We analysed findings of follow-up colonoscopies of FIT-positive screenees in the Dutch CRC screening program from 2014 until 2020. Data was retrieved from the national screening and pathology database. ASP was defined as any serrated polyp &#8805;10mm, sessile serrated lesion with dysplasia or traditional serrated adenoma. ASP detection rate was defined as the proportion of colonoscopies with &#8805;1 ASP. PPV was defined as proportion of persons with a CRC or AA. The updated PPV definition included CRC, AA and/or ASPs. <u>Results</u> In total, 322,882 colonoscopies were included in the analyses. Overall detection rate of ASPs was 5.9%. ASPs were more often detected in females than males (6.3% vs 5.6%, p&lt;0.001). ASP detection rates in individuals aged 55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70+ were 5.2%; 6.1%; 6.1%; 5.9% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. The PPV for CRC and AA was 41.1% and increased to 43.8% when including ASP. The PPV increase was larger in females than in males (3.2% vs 2.4%). <u>Conclusion</u> A proportion of 5.9% FIT-positive screenees had ASPs, but half of these were detected in combination with CRC or AA. Therefore, including ASPs results in a small increase in the yield of FIT-based screening.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Thieme. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Many clinical practice guidelines provide guidance for prevention and treatment; however, there are no specific recommendations for women. This is unfortunate because the proportion of women with breast- and gynecological cancers is high among patients with cancer-associated VTE. Thromboembolism often heralds cancer progression and poor prognosis and should-besides adequate anticoagulant management-also prompt reassessment and, if necessary, changes in cancer treatment. Recently, the new class of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has started to replace low-molecular-weight heparin as standard thromboprophylaxis and therapy in cancer patients. They are very effective, but they also carry a relevant risk of bleeding. Therefore, despite their ease of use, not every tumor patient qualifies for a DOAC, and this is especially true for gynecological tumor patients. Each prescription must be weighed individually. This review addresses specific aspects of VTE prophylaxis and management in women with cancer. Every physician who treats breast and gynecological cancers should be familiar with prophylaxis, diagnosis, and therapy of cancer-associated VTE. At the same time, patients should be informed by their physician what symptoms to look for and whom to contact if these symptoms occur, even outside of office hours and on weekends.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Thieme.

Integrating epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolic analyses with functional perturbation, we show that the tumor suppressor p53 preserves genomic integrity by empowering adequate levels of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In p53-deficient cells, perturbation of DNA methylation promotes derepression of heterochromatin, massive loss of histone H3-lysine 9 methylation, and consequent upregulation of satellite RNAs that triggers R-loop-associated replication stress and chromosomal aberrations. In p53-deficient cells, the inadequate SAM level underlies the inability to respond to perturbation because exogenous reintroduction of SAM represses satellite elements and restores the ability to cope with stress. Mechanistically, p53 transcriptionally controls genes involved in one-carbon metabolism, including Slc43a2, the methionine uptake transporter that is critical for SAM synthesis.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText Label=\"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Thermochemical ablation (TCA) is a thermal ablation technique involving the injection of acid and base, either sequentially or simultaneously, into the target tissue. TCA remains at the conceptual stage with existing studies unable to provide recommendations on the optimum injection rate, and reagent concentration and volume. Limitations in current experimental methodology have prevented proper elucidation of the thermochemical processes inside the tissue during TCA. Nevertheless, the computational TCA framework developed recently by Mak et&#160;al. [Mak et&#160;al., Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2022, 145:105494] has opened new avenues in the development of TCA. Specifically, a recommended safe dosage is imperative in driving TCA research beyond the conceptual stage.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">The aforesaid computational TCA framework for sequential injection was applied and adapted to simulate TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base at equimolar and equivolume. The developed framework, which describes the flow of acid and base, their neutralisation, the rise in tissue temperature and the formation of thermal damage, was solved numerically using the finite element method. The framework will be used to investigate the effects of injection rate, reagent concentration, volume and type (weak/strong acid-base combination) on temperature rise and thermal coagulation formation.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">A higher injection rate resulted in higher temperature rise and larger thermal coagulation. Reagent concentration of 7500&#160;mol/m<sup>3</sup> was found to be optimum in producing considerable thermal coagulation without the risk of tissue overheating. Thermal coagulation volume was found to be consistently larger than the total volume of acid and base injected into the tissue, which is beneficial as it reduces the risk of chemical burn injury. Three multivariate second-order polynomials that express the targeted coagulation volume as functions of injection rate and reagent volume, for the weak-weak, weak-strong and strong-strong acid-base combinations were also derived based on the simulated data.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">A guideline for a safe and effective implementation of TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base was recommended based on the numerical results of the computational model developed. The guideline correlates the coagulation volume with the reagent volume and injection rate, and may be used by clinicians in determining the safe dosage of reagents and optimum injection rate to achieve a desired thermal coagulation volume during TCA.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Joinpoint regression was used to compute the average annualized percentage change (AAPC) in cancer prevalence over time.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Across the study period, 12.7% of AIS admissions had previous/active cancer, while 4.4% had active cancer. Of these, 18.8% were hematologic cancers, 47.2% were solid cancers without metastasis and 34.0% were metastatic cancers of any type. Age-adjusted active cancer prevalence differed by sex (males:4.8%; females:4.0%) and increased with age up to age 70-79 years (30-39 years 1.4%; 70-79 years:5.7%).

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>The Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 (STEAP1) is an integral membrane protein involved in cellular communications, in the stimulation of cell proliferation by increasing Reactive Oxygen Species levels, and in the transmembrane-electron transport and reduction of extracellular metal-ion complexes. The STEAP1 is particularly over-expressed in prostate cancer, in contrast with non-tumoral tissues and vital organs, contributing to tumor progression and aggressiveness. However, the current understanding of STEAP1 lacks experimental data on the respective molecular mechanisms, structural determinants, and chemical modifications. This scenario highlights the relevance of exploring the biosynthesis of STEAP1 and its purification for further bio-interaction and structural characterization studies. In this work, recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human STEAP1 (rhSTEAP1-His<sub>6</sub>) was expressed in Komagataella pastoris (K. pastoris) mini-bioreactor methanol-induced cultures and successfully solubilized with Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) and n-Decyl-&#946;-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) detergents. The fraction capacity of Phenyl-, Butyl-, and Octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic matrices were evaluated by manipulating the ionic strength of binding and elution steps. Alternatively, immobilized metal affinity chromatography packed with nickel or cobalt were also studied in the isolation of rhSTEAP1-His<sub>6</sub> from lysate extracts. Overall, the Phenyl-Sepharose and Nickel-based resins provided the desired selectivity for rhSTEAP1-His<sub>6</sub> capture from NP-40 and DM detergent-solubilized K. pastoris extracts, respectively. After a polishing step using the anion-exchanger Q-Sepharose, a highly pure, fully solubilized, and immunoreactive 35 kDa rhSTEAP1-His<sub>6</sub> fraction was obtained. Altogether, the established reproducible strategy for the purification of rhSTEAP1-His<sub>6</sub> paves the way to gather additional insights on structural, thermal, and environmental stability characterization significantly contributing for the elucidation of the functional role and oncogenic behavior of the STEAP1 in prostate cancer microenvironment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

Bile samples of normal subjects (control) and HCC patients were newly included to examine if IR-based bile analysis could be expanded to identify HCC. Concentrations of three bile acids and eight bile salts in the aqueous phase samples were determined in parallel and lipidomic analysis of nine lipid classes in the organic phase samples was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentrations of bile salts were lower and relative abundances of bile salts were dissimilar between GB cancer samples and remained group samples. Also, the levels of lipids such as phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines were again lower and their relative abundances in the organic phase of GB cancer samples were different from those of other samples. IR spectral features of the aqueous, organic, and amphiphilic aggregate phases were individually characteristic, while not descriptive enough for the thorough identification of GB cancer. Nonetheless, since they were mutually complementary to represent different metabolites in bile, the use of three phase-merged spectra was synergetic to yield the superior discrimination of GB cancer.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the gene mutation information of melanoma cases is very important for its precise treatment. The current diagnostic methods for melanoma include radiological, pharmacological, histological, cytological and molecular techniques, but the gold standard for diagnosis is still pathological biopsy, which is time consuming and destructive. Raman spectroscopy is a rapid, sensitive and nondestructive detection method. In this study, a total of 20,000 Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of melanocytes and melanoma cells were collected using a positively charged gold nanoparticles planar solid SERS substrate, and a classification network system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was constructed to achieve the classification of melanocytes and melanoma cells, wild-type and mutant melanoma cells and their drug resistance. Among them, the classification accuracy of melanocytes and melanoma cells was over 98%. Raman spectral differences between melanocytes and melanoma cells were analyzed and compared, and the response of cells to antitumor drugs were also evaluated. The results showed that Raman spectroscopy provided a basis for the medication of melanoma, and SERS spectra combined with CNN classification model realized classification of melanoma, which is of great significance for rapid diagnosis and identification of melanoma.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022.

At the same time, scientific knowledge progresses continuously leading frequently to the identification of new molecular targets in the therapeutic area of oncology. This, together with further efforts to optimise next generation medicines, results in novel innovative products in development pipelines. In the context of global regulatory development requirements for these growing pipelines of innovative products (e.g. US RACE for children Act), it is an increasing challenge to complete development efforts in paediatric oncology, a therapeutic area of rare and life-threatening diseases with high unmet needs.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"OBJECTIVE\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Regulators recognise feasibility challenges of the regulatory obligations in this context. Here, we explain the EU regulatory decision making strategy applied to paediatric oncology, which aims fostering evidence generation to support developments based on needs and robust science. Because there is a plethora of products under development within given classes of or within cancer types, priorities need to be identified and updated as evidence evolves. This also includes identifying the need for third or fourth generation products to secure focused and accelerated drug development.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">An agreed PIP, as a plan, is a living document which can be modified in light of new evidence.

Cancer cells rarely develop in denervated organs, and denervation affects tumorigenesis, in vivo and in humans. Axonogenesis occurs to supply the new malignant epithelial growth with nerves. Neurogenesis happens later, first in ganglia around organs or the spinal column and subsequently through recruitment of neuroblasts from the central nervous system. The hallmark of this stage is regulation of homeostasis and energetic metabolism. Perineural invasion is the most efficient interaction between cancer cells and nerves. The hallmark of this stage is increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Finally, carcinoma cells transdifferentiate into a neuronal profile in search of neural independence. The latter is the last stage in neuroepithelial interactions. Treatments for cancer must address the biology of neural regulation of cancer.

Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis.

In this study, the prognostic value of positive SOX9 immunohistochemistry was compared with that of more established markers EpCAM and K19 in a large cohort (n=216) of North American patients. The independent HCC cohort in The Cancer Gene Atlas (n=360) was utilized to validate our findings. Finally, molecular signatures associated with SOX9-high HCC were determined. We found that the expression of SOX9, but not EpCAM or K19, was associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in our North American cohort, in which hepatitis C infection was the most common underlying etiology. High SOX9 mRNA level, but not increased expression of EpCAM mRNA or K19 mRNA, was also associated with worse DFS and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in The Cancer Gene Atlas cohort. This group had underlying causes, including an increased incidence of hepatitis B, significantly different from our initial cohort. High SOX9 mRNA level is associated with molecular pathways important in HCC pathogenesis. Increased SOX9 expression is clinically and biologically relevant for HCC arising in patients with a variety of underlying etiologies. Immunohistochemistry for SOX9 is a reliable proxy for increased SOX9 mRNA and can be used to predict prognosis in HCC cases.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A complement C1Q+ macrophage-like leukemia subset which is enriched within cutis and existed in BM prior to EMI manifestations was identified and further verified in multiple AML patients. Genomic and transcriptional profiling disclosed mutation and gene expression signatures of EMI patients that expressed high level of C1Q. RNA-sequencing and quantitative proteomics analysis revealed expression dynamics of C1Q from primary to relapse. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated adverse prognosis significance of C1Q expression. Mechanistically, C1Q expression, which was modulated by transcription factor MAFB, endowed leukemia cells with tissue-infiltration ability which could establish prominent cutaneous or gastrointestinal EMI nodules in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. Fibroblasts attracted migration of the C1Q+ leukemia cells through C1Q-gC1QR recognition and subsequent stimulation of TGF-&#946;1. This cell-cell communication also contributed to survival of C1Q+ leukemia cells under chemotherapy stress.

As their evolution is determined by factors that enable certain cellular subsets to outcompete others, techniques that resolve cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level are ideally placed to provide new insights into MPN biology. With these insights comes the potential to uncover new approaches to predict the clinical course and treat these cancers, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. MPNs present a particularly tractable model of cancer evolution, as most patients present in an early disease phase and only a small proportion progress to aggressive disease. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the groundbreaking technological advances in single-cell omics have been pioneered by their application in MPNs.

We generated a rhesus macaque (RM) FPDMM competitive repopulation model using CRISPR/Cas9 NHEJ editing in the RUNX1 gene and the AAVS1 safe-harbor control locus. We transplanted mixed populations of edited autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and tracked mutation allele frequencies in blood cells.

P/LP DDX41 germline variants explained ~80% of known germline predisposition to MNs in adults. These risk variants were 10-fold more enriched in Japanese MN cases (n=4,461) compared to a Japanese general population (n=20,238). This enrichment of DDX41 risk alleles was much more prominent in male than female (20.7 vs. 5.0). P/LP DDX41 variants conferred a large risk of developing MNs, which was negligible until 40 years old but rapidly increased to 49% by 90 years of age. DDX41-mutated MDS patients rapidly progressed to AML, which was, however, confined to those having truncating variants. Co-mutation patterns at diagnosis and at progression to AML were substantially different between DDX41-mutated and -WT cases, where none of the co-mutations affected clinical outcomes. Even TP53 mutations made no exceptions and their dismal effect, including multi-hit allelic status, on survival was almost completely mitigated by the presence of DDX41 mutations. Finally, outcomes were not affected by the conventional risk stratifications including the revised/molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R/M).

While all cell types secrete inactive, latent TGF-b1, only a few activate the cytokine via cell type-specific mechanisms. The cellular source of the active TGF-b1 implicated in PMF is not known. Transmembrane protein GARP binds and activates latent TGF-b1 on the surface of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and MKs or platelets. Here, we found increased expression of GARP in BM and spleen of mice undergoing PMF and tested the therapeutic potential of a monoclonal antibody that blocks TGF-b1 activation by GARP-expressing cells. GARP:TGF-b1 blockade reduced not only fibrosis, but also clonal expansion of transformed cells. Using mice carrying a genetic deletion of Garp in either Tregs or MKs, we found that the therapeutic effects of GARP:TGF-b1 blockade in PMF imply targeting GARP on Tregs. These therapeutic effects, accompanied by increased IFN-g signals in the spleen, were lost upon CD8 T cell depletion. Our results suggest that selective blockade of TGF-b1 activation by GARP-expressing Tregs increase a CD8 T cell-mediated immune reaction that limits transformed cell expansion, providing a novel approach that could be tested to treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022 American Society of Hematology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

In comparison with traditional polypyrrole without noble metal doping, the innovative introduction of WCl<sub>6</sub> not only successfully launched the polymerization of a pyrrole monomer but also endowed WPPy with additional radiosensitization. More importantly, after further decoration with an active targeted component (SP94 polypeptide), the obtained WPPy@SP94 significantly increased tumor internalization and accumulation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and induced obvious DNA damage as well as robust ROS generation under X-ray irradiation, which meanwhile synergized with strong photonic hyperthermia to effectively inhibit tumor growth by single drug injection.

Appalachian older adults experience disproportionate risks for poor health outcomes. Spirituality is integral to Appalachian culture, and many older adults use spiritual engagement (SE) to cope with health challenges. Despite these connections, there is limited evidence about SE and well-being in this population. Therefore, the current systematic review addresses the literature gap of how SE influences health of Appalachian older adults. Using thematic synthesis, we analyzed 11 qualitative and three mixed methods studies. Major findings indicate that SE positively impacts holistic health through adaptive coping, guided partnerships with God, decreased loneliness, and enhanced sense of purpose. Future studies could examine SE practices among diverse populations, SE virtual experiences, and SE nursing assessments. Understanding how SE influences health of Appalachian older adults could prepare nurses to reduce disparities and improve health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

The RNA-binding landscape for each fragment was studied by using a library-versus-library selection with an RNA library displaying a discrete structural element, probing over 12.8 million interactions, the greatest number of interactions between fragments and biomolecules probed experimentally. Mining of this dataset across the human transcriptome defined a drug-like fragment that potently and specifically targeted the microRNA-372 hairpin precursor, inhibiting its processing into the mature, functional microRNA and alleviating invasive and proliferative oncogenic phenotypes in gastric cancer cells. Importantly, this fragment has favorable properties, including an affinity for the RNA target of 300 &#177; 130 nM, a molecular weight of 273 Da, and quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED) score of 0.8.

The protein kinase B/AKT acts as a central node in cellular metabolism and is constitutively active in MM cells. Despite the known role of AKT in modulating cellular metabolism, little is known about the downstream factors of AKT that control the metabolic adaptability of MM cells. Here, we demonstrate that negative regulation of the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TF) by AKT is crucial to prevent metabolic shutdown in MM cells, thus contributing to their metabolic adaptability. Our results demonstrate that the expression of several key metabolic genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS, are repressed by FOXO TFs. Moreover, the FOXO-dependent repression of glycolysis- and TCA-associated genes correlates with a favorable prognosis in a large MM patient cohort.

We identified 150 genes that harbor local splicing variations in all pairwise comparisons. One of them encodes FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated as a cancer driver in several blood cancers. Surprisingly, we discovered that in normal human pro-B cells, the predominant transcript utilized an alternative first exon to produce the poorly characterized FBXW7&#946; isoform, previously thought to be restricted to neural tissues.

Regardless, both forms must survive acidic environments in the stomach and intestines to reach and colonize the gut, a process that partially relies on amino acid-dependent acid resistance (AR) mechanisms and modifications to membrane phospholipids. However, only the basic tenets of these mechanisms have been elucidated. In this paper, we aim to conduct a full-scale metabolic and lipidomic characterization of <i>E. coli's</i> adaptations to acid stress. We hypothesized that the use of untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics would reveal mechanisms downstream of AR processes that provide novel contributions to acid stress survival. We detected significant differences in the extracellular metabolome and the lipidome induced by amino acid supplementation (glutamine, arginine, or lysine) and contextualized these results using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). We additionally identified several metabolic pathways as well as a significant alteration in phospholipid synthetic pathways induced by differential amino acid supplementation. These results demonstrate that AR may extend beyond canonical mechanisms to a coordinated metabolic phenotype. Future studies may benefit from our analysis to further elucidate distinct targets for prebiotic supplements to cultivate commensal strains or therapies to combat pathogenic ones.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

SIRT1 loss impaired leukemia generation, while SIRT1 overexpression accelerated leukemia and conferred resistance to NOTCH1 inhibition in a deacetylase-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of SIRT1 resulted in significant antileukemic effects. Global acetyl-proteomics upon SIRT1 loss uncovered hyperacetylation of KAT7 and BRD1, subunits of a histone acetyltransferase complex targeting H4K12. Metabolic and gene expression profiling revealed metabolic changes together with a transcriptional signature resembling KAT7 deletion.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b\"<Abstract><AbstractText>IGF2BP2 binds to a number of RNA transcripts and has been suggested to function as a tumor promoter, although little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate its roles in RNA metabolism. Here we demonstrate that IGF2BP2 binds to the 3' untranslated region of the transcript encoding ATP6V1A, a catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), and serves as a substrate for the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which regulates how IGF2BP2 affects the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript. When sufficient levels of SIRT1 are expressed, it catalyzes the deacetylation of IGF2BP2, which can bind to the ATP6V1A transcript but does not mediate its degradation. However, when SIRT1 expression is low, the acetylated form of IGF2BP2 accumulates, and upon binding to the ATP6V1A transcript recruits the XRN2 nuclease, which catalyzes transcript degradation. Thus, the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript is significantly compromised in breast cancer cells when SIRT1 expression is low or knocked-down. This leads to a reduction in the expression of functional v-ATPase complexes in cancer cells and to an impairment in their lysosomal activity, resulting in the production of a cellular secretome consisting of increased numbers of exosomes enriched in ubiquitinated protein cargo and soluble hydrolases, including cathepsins, that together combine to promote tumor cell survival and invasiveness. These findings describe a previously unrecognized role for IGF2BP2 in mediating the degradation of a messenger RNA transcript essential for lysosomal function and highlight how its sirtuin-regulated acetylation state can have significant biological and disease consequences.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

We also identified Siglec-E as the main receptor for hypersialylation on TAMs. Last, we found that genetic and therapeutic desialylation, as well as loss of Siglec-E, enhanced the efficacy of ICB. Thus, therapeutic desialylation represents an immunotherapeutic approach to reshape macrophage phenotypes and augment the adaptive antitumor immune response.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

To alleviate this burden, improved prognostication and biomarkers of response are urgently needed. We investigated the use of whole-blood transcriptomics for stratification of patients with severe infection by integrating data from 3149 samples from patients with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia or fecal peritonitis admitted to intensive care and healthy individuals into a gene expression reference map. We used this map to derive a quantitative sepsis response signature (SRSq) score reflective of immune dysfunction and predictive of clinical outcomes, which can be estimated using a 7- or 12-gene signature. Last, we built a machine learning framework, SepstratifieR, to deploy SRSq in adult and pediatric bacterial and viral sepsis, H1N1 influenza, and COVID-19, demonstrating clinically relevant stratification across diseases and revealing some of the physiological alterations linking immune dysregulation to mortality. Our method enables early identification of individuals with dysfunctional immune profiles, bringing us closer to precision medicine in infection.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Here, we report that tumor-bearing mice exhibited response to treatment with combinatorial anti-programmed cell death 1 and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 antibodies but also presented with cardiovascular toxicities observed clinically with ICI therapy, including myocarditis and arrhythmia. Female mice were preferentially affected with myocarditis compared to male mice, consistent with a previously described genetic model of ICI myocarditis and emerging clinical data. Mechanistically, myocardial tissue from ICI-treated mice, the genetic mouse model, and human heart tissue from affected patients with ICI myocarditis all exhibited down-regulation of <i>MANF</i> (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) and <i>HSPA5</i> (heat shock 70-kDa protein 5) in the heart; this down-regulation was particularly notable in female mice. ICI myocarditis was amplified by heart-specific genetic deletion of mouse <i>Manf</i> and was attenuated by administration of recombinant MANF protein, suggesting a causal role. Ironically, both <i>MANF</i> and <i>HSPA5</i> were transcriptionally induced by liganded estrogen receptor &#946; and inhibited by androgen receptor. However, ICI treatment reduced serum estradiol concentration to a greater extent in female compared to male mice. Treatment with an estrogen receptor &#946;-specific agonist and androgen depletion therapy attenuated ICI-associated cardiac effects. Together, our data suggest that ICI treatment inhibits estradiol-dependent expression of <i>MANF/HSPA5</i> in the heart, curtailing the cardiomyocyte response to immune injury. This endocrine-cardiac-immune pathway offers new insights into the mechanisms of sex differences in cardiac disease and may offer treatment strategies for ICI myocarditis.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Although studied extensively in cancer, its biological role in the heart remains unresolved. PKM1 is more abundant than the PKM2 isoform in cardiomyocytes, and thus, we speculated that PKM2 is not genetically redundant to PKM1 and may be critical in regulating cardiomyocyte-specific transcription factors important for cardiac survival. Here, we showed that nuclear PKM2 (<sup>S37</sup>P-PKM2) in cardiomyocytes interacts with prosurvival and proapoptotic transcription factors, including GATA4, GATA6, and P53. Cardiomyocyte-specific PKM2-deficient mice (<i>Pkm2</i> Mut Cre<sup>+</sup>) developed age-dependent dilated cardiac dysfunction and had decreased amounts of GATA4 and GATA6 (GATA4/6) but increased amounts of P53 compared to Control Cre<sup>+</sup>&#160;hearts. Nuclear PKM2 prevented caspase-1-dependent cleavage and degradation of GATA4/6 while also providing a molecular platform for MDM2-mediated reduction of P53. In a preclinical heart failure mouse model, nuclear PKM2 and GATA4/6 were decreased, whereas P53 was increased in cardiomyocytes. Loss of nuclear PKM2 was ubiquitination dependent and associated with the induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM35. In mice, cardiomyocyte-specific TRIM35 overexpression resulted in decreased <sup>S37</sup>P-PKM2 and GATA4/6 along with increased P53 in cardiomyocytes compared to littermate controls and similar cardiac dysfunction to <i>Pkm2</i> Mut Cre<sup>+</sup>&#160;mice. In patients with dilated left ventricles, increase in TRIM35 was associated with decreased <sup>S37</sup>P-PKM2 and GATA4/6 and increased P53.

The medical data classification faces the imbalanced count of data samples, here at least one class forms only a very small minority of the data, but it is a drawback of most of the machine learning algorithms. The medical datasets are mostly imbalanced in its class labels. When the dataset is imbalanced, the existing classification algorithms typically perform badly on minority class cases. To deal the class imbalance issue, an enhanced generative adversarial network (E-GAN) is proposed in this article. The proposed approach is the consolidation of deep convolutional generative adversarial network and modified convolutional neural network (DCG-MCNN). Initially, the imbalanced data is converted into balanced data in pre-processing process. Data preprocessing comprise of data cleaning, data normalization, data transformation and data reduction using Radius Synthetic minority oversampling technique (RSMOTE) method. The DCG is considered for balancing the dataset generating extra samples under training dataset. This training dataset based, the medical disease classification is enhanced by modified CNN diagnosis model. The proposed system performed is executed in MATLAB. The performance analysis is implemented under the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset that provides the higher maximum geometry mean (MGM) of 8.686, 2.931 and 5.413%, and higher Matthews's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 9.776, 1.841 and 5.413% compared to the existing methods.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

A 54-year-old man presented with progressive cervical radiculopathy that had persisted for 3 months. The underlying disease was HCC. Radiographic examination revealed evidence of metastatic spinal cord compression with an epidural mass at the C4-C5 levels, which compressed the C4-C5 spinal cord without bony destruction. The modified Tomita score was 6 to 8 points based on palliative surgery. A posterior full-endoscopic approach to remove the tumor from the metastasis of HCC in the cervical spine was done. A postoperative radiographic study revealed adequate tumor mass resection and spinal decompression. The patient was extremely satisfied with this alternative treatment and achieved complete neurologic recovery at 1 month and no recurrent symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. The technique of posterior full-endoscopic decompression of cervical metastasis causing unilateral radiculopathy, presented in this study, is feasible.

This can result in hemodynamic instability in the presence of other bleeding sources. It is oftentimes difficult to diagnose due to its limitations to visual inspection of the oropharyngeal structures. It is commonly mistaken for hemoptysis or hematemesis upon initial evaluation. Trauma, infection, pulmonary pathologies (ie, lung cancer or tuberculosis), gastrointestinal pathologies (ie, esophageal/gastric varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, esophagitis), coagulopathies, medications, and prolonged intubation have been shown to increase the risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with a medical history of alcohol use disorder, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and gastric varices presented with altered mental status. He was subsequently intubated for airway protection. Bleeding from the oropharynx was later found. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and bronchoscopy were unrevealing. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck revealed active bleeding of the right posterior pharyngeal artery, which was emergently embolized. Over the next few days, he continued to bleed from the oropharynx and became hemodynamically unstable. CTA abdomen showed bleeding from gastric varices and large-volume hemoperitoneum with multiple sources of active bleeding from the liver, duodenum, and jejunum. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage and gastric variceal bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock in a cirrhotic patient with multiple predisposing factors. If a patient presents with spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage, clinicians should consider bleeding from the oropharynx if EGD and bronchoscopy are unrevealing. Thus, an emergent CTA of the head and neck should be strongly considered to further evaluate a potential source of active bleeding, as delayed diagnosis can be life-threatening.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

However, for many years, the inherent high affinity of CO for hemoglobin severely impeded the clinical transformation of CO-based treatments. Therefore, the controlled delivery of CO to target tissues has become a common challenge. Herein, an efficient ultrasonic-triggered and targeted CO release strategy was constructed based on a novel targeted acoustic release carrier of carbon monoxide (TARC-CO) that we synthesized in this study. The designed TARC-COs could afford a safe, stable, and ultrasound-guided delivery of CO in vivo by loading a specified dose of CO inside microbubbles, resulting in breast tumor suppression. Taking advantage of the high loading capacity of microbubbles, the unit volume of TARC-CO suspension could encapsulate up to 337.1 &#177; 8.0 (&#215;10<sup>3</sup> ppm) of CO. In addition, the satisfactory ultrasound contrast-enhanced ability of TARC-COs achieved real-time interactive guidance and visual policing of CO delivery. For the in vitro antitumor study, TARC-COs with ultrasonic irradiation were demonstrated to effectively induce mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the apoptosis of 4T1 cells. In addition, we realized that TARC-CO-based treatment could significantly slow the growth rate of tumors by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, and limiting tumor angiogenesis. In summary, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility and tremendous potential of TARC-COs for controlled release of CO, which can be expected to provide new inspirations and a promising perspective for therapy based on active gases.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

In 1981, Best and Hoekstra reported four patients with BWSp in a single family which suggested autosomal dominant inheritance, but standard clinical testing for BWSp was not available during this time. Meticulous phenotyping of this family has occurred over the past 40&#8201;years of follow-up with additional family members being identified and samples collected for genetic testing. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in CDKN1C, consistent with the most common cause of familial BWSp. CDKN1C mutations account for just 5% of sporadic cases of BWSp. Here, we report the variable presentation of BWSp across the individuals affected by the CDKN1C mutation and other extended family members spanning multiple generations, all examined by the same physician. Additional phenotypes thought to be atypical in patients with BWSp were reported which included cardiac abnormalities. The incidence of tumors was documented in extended family members and included rhabdomyosarcoma, astrocytoma, and thyroid carcinoma, which have previously been reported in patients with BWSp. These observations suggest that in addition to the inheritance of the CDKN1C variant, there are modifying factors in this family driving the phenotypic spectrum observed. Alternative theories are suggested to explain the etiology of clinical variability including diffused mosaicism, anticipation, and the presence of additional variants tracking in the family.

However, this simple division of labor model struggles to explain why TFs with identical DNA binding sequence specificity determined <i>in vitro</i> exhibit distinct binding profiles <i>in vivo</i>. The family of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) offer a stark example: aberrantly expressed in several cancer types, HIF-1&#945; and HIF-2&#945; subunit isoforms recognize the same DNA motif <i>in vitro</i> - the hypoxia response element (HRE) - but only share a subset of their target genes <i>in vivo</i>, while eliciting contrasting effects on cancer development and progression under certain circumstances. To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-&#945; subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1&#946; exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2&#945; specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Using Cut&amp;Run and RNA-seq as orthogonal genomic approaches we also confirmed IDR-dependent binding and activation of a specific subset of HIF-target genes.

Due to their low molecular weight, such hits tend to have low, often unquantifiable, affinity for their target, complicating the twin challenges of validating the hits as authentic solution-phase ligands of the target and identifying the `best' hit(s) for further elaboration. In this article, approaches that address these challenges are assessed. Using retrospective analysis of a recent ATAD2 hit-identification campaign, alongside other examples of successful fragment-screening campaigns, it is suggested that hit validation and prioritization are best achieved by a `triangulation' approach in which the results of multiple available biochemical and biophysical techniques are correlated to develop qualitative structure-activity relationships (SARs). Such qualitative SARs may indeed be the only means by which to navigate a project through the tunnel of uncertainty that prevails before on-scale biophysical, biochemical and/or biological measurements become possible.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>open access.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

An initial response to an epithelial wound is an increase in cytosolic calcium followed by complex calcium signaling events. While these calcium signals are driven by both physical and chemical wound responses, cells around the wound will all be equipped with the same cellular components to produce and interact with the calcium signals. Here, we have developed a mathematical model in the context of laser-ablation of the <i>Drosophila</i> pupal notum that integrates tissue-level damage models with a cellular calcium signaling toolkit. The model replicates experiments in the contexts of control wounds as well as knockdowns of specific cellular components, but it also provides new insights that are not easily accessible experimentally. The model suggests that cell-cell variability is necessary to produce calcium signaling events observed in experiments, it quantifies calcium concentrations during wound-induced signaling events, and it shows that intercellular transfer of the molecule IP<sub>3</sub> is required to coordinate calcium signals across distal cells around the wound. The mathematical model developed here serves as a framework for quantitative studies in both wound signaling and calcium signaling in the <i>Drosophila</i> system.

TTBK2 is also implicated in the stability of the assembled cilium, through mechanisms that remain to be defined. Here, we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <i>Ttbk2<sup>fl/</sup><sup>fl</sup>; UBC-CreERT+</i> embryos (hereafter <i>Ttbk2<sup>cmut</sup></i>) to dissect the role of TTBK2 in cilium stability. This system depletes TTBK2 levels after cilia formation, allowing us to assess the molecular changes to the assembled cilium over time. As a consequence of <i>Ttbk2</i> deletion, the ciliary axoneme is destabilized and primary cilia are lost within 48-72 hours following recombination. Axoneme destabilization involves an increased frequency of cilia breaks and a reduction in axonemal microtubule modifications. Cilia loss was delayed by using inhibitors that affect actin-based trafficking. At the same time, we find that TTBK2 is required to regulate the composition of the centriolar satellites and to maintain the basal body pools of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. Altogether, our results reveal parallel pathways by which TTBK2 maintains cilium stability. [Media: see text] [Media: see text] [Media: see text].</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Thus, water resources should be protected from PTEs, and their effect on the exposed population should be investigated. In the present investigation, the concentrations of PTEs such as&#160;lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), and iron(Fe) in the drinking water of Shiraz, Iran, were determined for the first time. In addition, hazard quotient, hazard index, cancer risk, and sensitivity analysis were applied to estimate the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic impacts of Pb, Hg, Mn, and Fe on exposed children and adults through ingestion. The mean concentrations (&#181;g/L) of Pb, Hg, Mn, and Fe were 0.36, 0.32, 2.28, and 8.72, respectively, in winter and 0.50, 0.20, 0.55, and 10.36, respectively, in summer. The results displayed that Fe concentration was more than the other PTEs. PTE concentrations were lower than the standard values of the Environment Protection Agency and World Health Organization. Values of the degree of contamination and heavy metal pollution index for lead, mercury, manganese, and iron were significantly low (&lt;&#8201;1) and excellent (&lt;&#8201;50), respectively. Based on the Spearman rank correlation analysis, positive and negative relationships were observed in the present study. The observations of the health risk assessment demonstrated that mercury, lead, iron, and manganese had an acceptable level of noncarcinogenic harmful health risk in exposed children and adults (hazard quotients&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1 and hazard index&#8201;&lt;&#8201;1). The carcinogenic risk of lead was low (&lt;&#8201;E&#8201;-&#8201;06), which can be neglected. Monte Carlo simulation showed that water intake rate and mercury concentration were the most critical parameters in the hazard index for children and adults. Lead concentration was also the most crucial factor in the cancer risk analysis.

Still, the lack of selective inhibitors hinders further therapeutic development and limits the exploration of its biological mechanism. This study constructed an integrated protocol that combines pharmacophore modeling, structure-based virtual screening, and Molecular Dynamic Simulation. It was then used as a screening query to identify hit compounds targeted at the substrate recognition site of FBXW8 from a large-scale compound database including 120 million compounds. Then, ten lead compounds were retrieved by using molecular docking analysis and ADMET prediction. Finally, MD simulations were performed to validate the binding stability of selected drug candidates.

Our previous study found that bisecting N-glycans are commonly increased in ICC, while the effects and potential functions of bisecting GlcNAc in ICC are still largely unclear. In this study, we further confirmed that the structures of bisecting GlcNAc were significantly up-regulated in ICC compared with paracancer tissues by glycoproteomic data and lectin histochemistry. The expression of its glycosyltransferase MGAT3 was also up-regulated in ICC tissues at both mRNA and protein levels, and expression of MGAT3 is negatively correlated with overall survival explored by bioinformatic analyses and published datasets from 255 patients. Next, the silencing of MGAT3 could inhibit the growth and invasion of ICC cells, and overexpressing of MGAT3 only promoted ICC cell invasion. Further glycoproteomic analysis showed that the commonly glycoproteins modified by bisecting GlcNAc after MGAT3-overexpression in two ICC cell lines were mainly involved in cell movement-related biological processes, such as cell adhesion, integrin-related and ECM-receptor interaction. This study sheds light on the potential effects of bisecting GlcNAc in ICC cells and suggests that MGAT3 might be used as a potential target in the therapy of ICC.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The expression of these markers was maximal in the foci of highly pronounced dysplasia, but was not detected in the foci of carcinoma in situ and microinvasion, when the cells reach the stroma with abundant vascular supply.

In this context, we set out to determine the concentrations of heavy metals in the muscle of two fish species of commercial interest, Chelon auratus and Chelon saliens on the south coast of the Caspian Sea. We aimed to assess the degree of environment contamination in this area and to estimate the potential risk to human health derived from the consumption of fish. The mean concentrations of the different metals analysed were very varied in both species. In fact, some concentrations exceeded the permissible limits for the protection of human health for Cd and Pb, and some values of As were above those referenced by other authors in same species in the Caspian Sea. None of the estimated daily intake values exceeded the tolerable intake based on the consumption under consideration. Nonetheless, the accumulative hazard values evidenced a potential risk to human health, Pb and Hg being those giving a higher target hazard quotient. The cancer risk from exposure to As from fish consumption in children was above the \"acceptable\" risk to life. Thus, in view of the accumulative nature of heavy metals, a moderate and non-abusive fish consumption in this area, particularly in children, would be recommendable.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Lipid-shelled nanobubbles (NBs) are emerging as potential dual diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Similar to their micron-scale counterparts, microbubbles (1-10 &#956;m), they can act as ultrasound contrast agents as well as locally enhance therapeutic uptake. Recently, it has been shown that the reduced size of NBs (&lt;1 &#956;m) promotes increased uptake and accumulation in tumor interstitial space, which can enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic performance. However, accurate characterization of NB size and concentration is challenging and may limit their translation into clinical use. Their submicron nature limits accuracy of conventional microscopy techniques, while common light scattering techniques fail to distinguish between subpopulations present in NB samples (i.e., bubbles and liposomes). Due to the difficulty in the characterization of NBs, relatively little is known about the influence of size on their therapeutic performance. In this study, we describe a novel method of using a commercially available nanoparticle tracking analysis system, to distinguish between NBs and liposomes based on their differing optical properties. We used this technique to characterize three NB populations of varying size, isolated via centrifugation, and subsequently used this to assess their potential for enhancing localized delivery. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify the ultrasound enhanced uptake of fluorescent dextran into live colorectal cancer cells. Our results showed that the amount of localized uptake did not follow the expected trends, in which larger NB populations out-perform smaller NBs, at matched concentration. To understand this observed behavior, the stability of each NB population was assessed. It was found that dilution of the NB samples from their stock concentration influences their stability, and it is hypothesized that both the total free lipid and interbubble distance play a role in NB lifetime, in agreement with previously proposed theories and models.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

This information is supported by in vitro and in vivo studies that evidenced its anti-angiogenic, anti-tumorigenic, and anti-metastatic properties. Although OI is related to skeletal changes such as bone fragility and deformities, as well as to other connective tissue defects, it does not represent a greater predisposition to the development of skeletal tumors. Here, we report on an adult with OI in which a deletion in exon 8 of the SERPINF1 gene (c.1152_1170del; p.384_390del) was identified.

Common features include fetal akinesia, fractures, contractures, dysphagia, respiratory failure, and neonatal death. Here, we describe a 26-year-old man with relatively mild NEM8. He presented with hypotonia and bilateral femur fractures at birth, later developing bilateral Achilles' contractures, scoliosis, and elbow and knee contractures. He had walking difficulties throughout childhood and became wheelchair bound from age 13 after prolonged immobilisation. Muscle MRI at age 13 indicated prominent fat replacement in his pelvic girdle, posterior compartments of thighs, and vastus intermedius. Muscle biopsy revealed nemaline bodies and intranuclear rods. RNA sequencing and western blotting of patient skeletal muscle indicated significant reduction in KLHL40 mRNA and protein respectively. Using gene panel screening, exome sequencing and RNA sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous variants in KLHL40; a truncating 10.9&#160;kb deletion in trans with a likely pathogenic variant (c.*152G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Computational tools SpliceAI and Introme predicted the c.*152G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T variant created a cryptic donor splice site. RNA-seq and in vitro analyses indicated that the c.*152G&#8201;&gt;&#8201;T variant induces multiple de novo splicing events that likely provoke nonsense mediated decay of KLHL40 mRNA explaining the loss of mRNA expression and protein abundance in the patient. Analysis of 3' UTR variants in ClinVar suggests variants that introduce aberrant 3' UTR splicing may be underrecognised in Mendelian disease. We encourage consideration of this mechanism during variant curation.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Some indirect data suggest that the pandemic has worsened the stage at which some non-hematological neoplasms are diagnosed. Despite the lack of robust evidence, oncology patients seem more likely to have a poor outcome when they contract COVID-19. The antibody response to infection in cancer patients will be fundamentally conditioned by the type of neoplasia present, the treatment received and the time of its administration. In patients with hematological malignancies, the incidence of infection is probably similar or lower than in the general population, due to the better protective measures adopted by the patients and their environment. The severity and mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies is clearly higher than the general population. Since the immune response to vaccination in hematologic patients is generally worse than in comparable populations, alternative methods of prevention must be established in these patients, as well as actions for earlier diagnosis and treatment. Campaigns for the early diagnosis of malignant neoplasms must be urgently resumed, post-COVID manifestations should be monitored, collaboration with patient associations is indisputable and it is urgent to draw the right conclusions to improve our preparedness to fight against possible future catastrophes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169;The Author 2022.

However, this places stringent constraints on therapeutic development, requiring cancer targets that have high expression of internalising antigens and efficient intracellular processing. An alternative approach is emerging whereby the payloads can be released extracellularly from cleavable linkers upon binding to poorly-internalising antigens or other tumoral components. This removes the reliance on high antigen expression, avoids potentially inefficient internalisation, and can greatly expand the range of cancer targets to components of the extracellular tumour matrix. This review gives an overview of recent developments towards non-internalising ADCs, including emerging cancer-associated cell surface and extracellular proteins, cancer stromal targeting and the linking chemistry that enables extracellular payload release.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

For low-risk SCC, 5 guidelines recommended annual follow-up; 3 guidelines, every 6 months; and 1 guideline, every 3 months. For high-risk SCC, recommendations included a range of follow-up frequencies, spanning every 3 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;5 guidelines), 4 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;1), 6 months (n&#8201;=&#8201;6), or annually (n&#8201;=&#8201;4).

The strategy to suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content has not been fully elucidated. As previous studies reported that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) ingestion increased mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, we evaluated whether BCAA supplementation could suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content. Six-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control (Con), endurance training (Tr), detraining (DeTr), and detraining with BCAA supplementation (DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA). Mice in Tr, DeTr, and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA performed treadmill running exercises [20-30&#8201;m/min, 60&#8201;min, 5 times/week, 4&#8201;weeks]. Then, mice in DeTr and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA were administered with water or BCAA [0.6&#160;mg/g of body weight, twice daily] for 2&#8201;weeks of detraining. In whole skeletal muscle, mitochondrial enzyme activities and protein content were decreased after 2&#8201;weeks of detraining, but the reduction was suppressed by BCAA supplementation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;) protein content, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was decreased by detraining irrespective of BCAA ingestion. Regarding mitochondrial degradation, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19&#8201;kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitophagy-related protein, was significantly higher in the Tr group than in the DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA group, but not different from in the DeTr group. With respect to mitochondrial quality, BCAA ingestion did not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in isolated mitochondria. Our findings suggest that BCAA ingestion suppresses the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content partly through inhibiting mitophagy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

It is a severe and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that requires early identification and management. The diagnosis of CIP should be carefully distinguished from other forms of pulmonary diseases. Recognizing risk factors and typical symptoms helps to raise suspicion of CIP. Further characterization of the unique radiographic and pathological features is warranted to expedite diagnosis. The identification of potential biomarkers for CIP is emerging and has great relevance in the clinic. Multidisciplinary collaborations involving oncologists, radiologists and pulmonologists may facilitate uniform management strategies. Treatment discontinuation is the mainstay for treating CIP of all grades.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>Theranostics describes the coupling of a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic agent (i.e., a theranostic pair) that share a common target in tumor cells or their microenvironment. The term is increasingly associated with in vivo nuclear medicine oncologic applications that couple diagnostic imaging from gamma radiation with concomitant localized high-energy particulate radiation to a tissue expressing the common target. Several theranostic pairs have been translated into clinical practice in the United States and are poised to become a mainstay for cancer treatment. This article reviews experience to date with theranostics for solid-organ malignancies, addressing the practical integration into care pathways of beta-emitting therapies that include somatostatin analog radioligands for neuroendocrine tumors, prostate-specific membrane antigen-directed therapy for prostate cancer, and 131I-MIBG therapy for tumors of neural crest origin. Toxicities related to theranostics administration, as well as indications for therapy cessation in patients who experience adverse events, are also discussed. A multidisciplinary team-based approach for identifying patients most likely to respond to these agents, determining the optimal time for therapy delivery, and managing their care throughout the therapy course, is critical to the success of a radiotheranostic program.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The 68Ga-fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (68Ga-FAPI) targets tumor stroma, leading to high accumulation across cancer types. <b>Objective:</b> To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT in detecting PM based on studies providing head-to-head comparisons between the two tests. <b>Evidence Acquisition:</b> PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through July 2022 to identify studies reporting head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT for detection of PM. Reference standard was classified as histopathology in all patients, or as combination of histopathology, clinical, imaging, laboratory, and follow-up information (i.e., multidisciplinary reference standard). Random-effects statistical model was applied to conduct a meta-analysis of tests' diagnostic performances in patient-based and lesion-based analyses. QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C tools were used to assess study quality. <b>Evidence Synthesis:</b> Eleven studies were included; patient-based analysis comprised nine studies with 340 patients, and lesion-based analysis comprised four studies with 222 lesions. Pooled sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was significantly higher than that of FDG PET/CT in patient-based analysis [98.2% (95% CI: 96.1-100.0%) vs 55.9% (95% CI: 33.9-77.9%)] and lesion-based analysis [99.9% (95% CI: 99.5-100.0%) vs 27.3% (95% CI: 11.2-43.4%)]. Eight studies were rated as high risk of bias in the reference standard domain because the multidisciplinary reference standard was not sufficiently explained and may have included one of the two index tests, which would have artificially increased sensitivity. Specificity was reported in three studies as 100.0% for both tests; these studies were considered at uncertain risk of bias in the patient selection domain because patients with benign peritoneal conditions may have been excluded, resulting in underestimation of potential false-positive results. <b>Conclusion:</b> Current evidence suggests excellent sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for the detection of PM, in comparison to poorer sensitivity of FDG PET/CT. However, most included studies had high risk of bias, with need for further studies that could more convincingly characterize true- and false-positive results. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> The use of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may offer substantially improved sensitivity compared with FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of PM, facilitating surgical candidate selection and planning.</AbstractText></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Eighty-one patients (38 men, 43 women; mean age, 60.5&#177;8.9 years; lobectomy in 43, limited resection in 38) were included. Patients underwent thoracic DECT and PFT evaluation preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Pulmonary lobes were segmented. Lobar volume and perfusion ratios (both relative to whole-lung values) were computed. Perfusion measures reflected DECT-derived iodine content. Patients completed 6-month postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> Patients undergoing lobectomy, versus limited resection, exhibited greater increases in lung volume ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (42.3&#177;24.2% vs 22.9&#177;13.2%, p&lt;.001) and of contralateral lung (14.6&#177;14.0% vs 6.4&#177;6.9%, p=.002), and greater increases in lung perfusion ratio of ipsilateral nonresected lobe(s) (39.9&#177;20.7% vs 22.8&#177;17.8%, p&lt;.001) and of contralateral lung (20.9&#177;9.4% vs 4.3&#177;5.6%, p&lt;.001). In patients with right lower lobe tumors, largest postoperative increases in lung volume ratio were in right middle lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (44.1&#177;21.0%) and limited resection (24.6&#177;14.5%), whereas largest postoperative increase in lung perfusion ratio was in left lower lobe in those undergoing lobectomy (53.9&#177;8.6%) and in right middle lobe in those undergoing limited resection (32.5&#177;24.1%). Otherwise, largest volume and perfusion ratio increases occurred in ipsilateral nonresected lobes (vs contralateral lobes) regardless of operative approach and lobar location.

Despite the decline in HIV-associated complications because of the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy two decades ago, Kaposi sarcoma continues to affect PLWH worldwide. It affects young African American men more than other age and racial groups and can result in multiorgan dysfunction, leading to short-term and chronic debilitating symptoms as well as death. While some patients with epidemic Kaposi sarcoma are managed as outpatients, others may require higher levels of care and their acuity may fluctuate throughout their life span. Therefore, nurses, regardless of their specialty, may experience caring for a patient with epidemic Kaposi sarcoma at some point in their career. Learning about this condition and the needs of patients who have it will help nurses provide effective care. Here, the authors describe Kaposi sarcoma in general as well as the epidemiology, characteristics, and management of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have been extensively studied as biomarkers in cancer and haematological disorders, and their expression has been correlated to the presence of recurrent molecular abnormalities, expression of oncogenes, as well as to prognosis/clinical outcome. In the present study, expression signatures of different miRs related both to presence of myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukaemia 1 and Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications rearrangements and to the clinical outcome of paediatric patients with AML were identified. Notably, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p resulted as a possible relapse-risk related miR. Thus, miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p expression modulation was investigated by using a Bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor (JQ1) and a natural compound that acts as histone acetyl transferase inhibitor (curcumin), alone or in association, in order to decrease acetylation of histone tails and potentiate the effect of BRD4 inhibition. JQ1 modulates miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p expression in AML with a synergic effect when associated with curcumin. Moreover, changes were observed in the expression of <i>CDKN1B</i>, a known target of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p, increase in apoptosis and downregulation of miR-221-3p and miR-222-3p expression in CD34<sup>+</sup> AML primary cells. Altogether, these findings suggested that several miRs expression signatures at diagnosis may be used for risk stratification and as relapse prediction biomarkers in paediatric AML outlining that epigenetic drugs, could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for high-risk paediatric patients with AML. For these epigenetic drugs, additional research for enhancing activity, bioavailability and safety is needed.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Realgar is an impelling anticancer drug, however its significance in KRAS mutant lung cancer is uncertain. According to our findings, the IC<sub>50</sub> of H23 (KRAS mutant) cells is 2.99&#160;times lower than that of H1650 (non&#8209;KRAS mutant) cells. Flow cytometry and the Hoechst 33258 staining assay revealed that H1650 cells treated with 4&#160;&#181;g/ml realgar had an apoptotic rate of 8.2%, while H23 cells had a rate of 21.46%. Accordingly, realgar was more sensitive to KRAS mutant cells. Transcriptome sequencing test indicated that there were 481 different expression genes in H23 cells treated with realgar. In H23 cells treated with realgar, mitochondria shrank, inner membrane folding was disturbed, and mitochondrial membrane potential crushed. Realgar boosted intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup>, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and glutathione levels, which were all reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor Fer&#8209;1. Realgar decreased phosphorylated p&#8209;Raf, p&#8209;ERK1/2 and increased p&#8209;p38 and p&#8209;JNK, whereas only p&#8209;Raf was abolished by Fer&#8209;1. Raf inhibitor Sorafenib accelerated the realgar&#8209;induced ferroptosis. On H23 cells treated with realgar, the expression of GPX4, SCL7A11 decreased while ACSL4 expression increased; this effect could also be amplified by Sorafenib. In conclusion, the present study indicated that realgar may induce ferroptosis by regulating the Raf, and hence plays a role in anti&#8209;KRAS mutant lung cancer.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

In the present study, a novel TA autoantibody was detected, which may prove to be useful as a diagnostic marker of human HCC using an HBx&#8209;transgenic (HBx&#8209;tg) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model. Its target antigen was identified as the bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 2 (BRD2), a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional control of diverse genes. BRD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues of the H&#8209;ras12V&#8209;tg mouse and human subjects, as demonstrated using western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis, with the BRD2 autoantibody. In addition, the truncated BRD2 reactive to the BRD2 autoantibody was detected in tumor cell&#8209;derived exosomes, which possibly activated TA immune responses and the generation of autoantibodies. For the detection of the serum BRD2 autoantibody, epitope mimicries of autoantigenic BRD2 were screened from a random cyclic peptide CX<sub>7</sub>C library with the BRD2 autoantibody. A mimotope with the sequence of CTSVFLPHC, which was cyclized by one pair of cysteine residues, exhibited high affinity to the BRD2 autoantibody and competitively inhibited the binding of the autoantibody to the cellular BRD2 antigen. The use of this cyclic peptide as a capture antigen in human serum enzyme&#8209;linked immunosorbent assay allowed the distinction of patients with HCC from healthy subjects with 64.41% sensitivity and 82.42% specificity (area under the ROC curve, 0.7761), which is superior to serum alpha&#8209;fetoprotein (AFP; 35.83% sensitivity; 100% specificity; area under the ROC curve, 0.5337) for the diagnosis of HCC. In addition, the detection of the BRD2 autoantibody combined with other autoantibody biomarkers or AFP has increased the accuracy of HCC diagnosis, suggesting that the combinational detection of cancer biomarkers, including the BRD2 autoantibody, is a promising assay for HCC diagnosis.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

To enable early diagnosis and regular monitoring and improve automation, the development of integrated point-of-care (POC) and biosensors is needed.

Median times to TP1 and TP2 relative to start of treatment were 21 and 45&#8201;days, respectively.

(3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"DATA SOURCES\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE<sup>&#174;</sup> (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase<sup>&#174;</sup> (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of Science&#8482; (Clarivate&#8482;, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP ) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews ( KSR ) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"REVIEW METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"LIMITATIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia).</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"FUTURE WORK\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies. Large prospective cohort studies in which all participants receive accurate tests for coeliac disease are needed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"STUDY REGISTRATION\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019115506 and CRD42020170766.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"FUNDING\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research ( NIHR ) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 26, No. 44.

In the present study, we aimed to study the immunostaining pattern of TMSB4X in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that normal thyroid tissue or benign thyroid disorders exhibited undetectable immunoreactivity against TMSB4X except for positive staining of inflammatory infiltrates and stromal cells associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. By contrast, overexpression of TMSB4X was observed in a variety of thyroid malignancies, including papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Among 141 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, higher TMSB4X expression was associated with papillary tumor type, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and BRAF V600E mutation. The results were consistent with those from the public transcriptomic datasets. In summary, TMSB4X expression was aberrantly increased in various types of thyroid cancer, and higher TMSB4X expression was correlated with advanced disease characteristics. Thymosin beta-4 may be a novel downstream effector of the BRAF V600E mutation.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

The combination of photothermal and immunotherapy has proven to be a promising method to conquer technical challenges. Inhibiting the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immune pathway represents one of the most successful immunotherapy strategies. Whereas, the PD-L1 expression level significantly differs, leading to a relatively low response rate to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) approaches. Therefore, improving the expression level of PD-L1 becomes one potential method to enhance the response rate. Herein, NIH 3T3 cells were educated to steadily express PD-1 protein. Furthermore, the synthesized molybdenum nitride was then coated with PD-1 protein-modified cytomembrane, which endows it with immune checkpoint blocking capability. Moreover, under the irradiation of near-infrared light, the local mild heat released from the molybdenum nitride causes the apoptosis of tumor cells. More importantly, the elevated temperature simultaneously helps elevate the expression level of PD-L1, further enhancing the response rate of ICB. Finally, the PD-1 cytomembrane coatings interact with the upregulated PD-L1, leading to the activation of the immune system. In summary, we confirmed that the PD-1 protein-coated molybdenum nitride could synergistically ablate tumors and avoid metastasis.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Both vitamin K3 and phthiocol possess anticancer and antihemorrhagic properties. Phthiocol is a noninnocent ligand and provides monodentate, bidentate, or tridentate coordination sites to metal ions. A series of transition metal complexes (Mn(II); 1 and 1A, Co(II); 2 and 2A, Ni(II); 3 and 3A, Cu(II); 4 and 4A, and Zn(II); 5 and 5A) are synthesized at 0 &#176;C using sodium metal (1 to 5) and at 26 &#176;C (1A to 5A). The chemical composition of the complexes obtained is of the type [M(phthiocolate)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]. At room temperature (26 &#176;C), <i>trans</i> coordination of the phthiocolate ligand is achieved (1A through 5A), whereas at 0 &#176;C and using sodium metal as a reductant, <i>cis</i> coordination is observed in Mn(II) complexes (1 and its methanol adduct 1B). A Na(I) complex of phthiocol, Na(pht), is isolated as a polymer. The ligand phthiocol and the complexes Na(pht), 1, 1A, and 3 crystallize in a monoclinic crystal system. X-ray structures reveal that the bond distances of coordinated phthiocol ligands are in the reduced naphthosemiquinone form in the complexes synthesized at 0 &#176;C. The metal complexes of phthiocol (pht) were evaluated for their anticancer activity against MCF-7 (breast) and A549 (lung) cancer cell lines. Experiments like apoptosis, mitochondrial potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, effect on the cell cycle, and cell proliferation were performed to compare selected complexes against both cell lines. The metal complexes of phthiocol synthesized at 0 &#176;C showed substantial cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and A549 cell lines. Further, effect of selected phthiocol complexes on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was adventitious to realize their safety. Vitamin K3, phthiocol, and metal complex 4 successfully inhibited the enzymatic activity of human topoisomerase II. The multifunctionality of any anticancer agent influencing apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, the effect on the cell cycle, and cell proliferation is crucial for defining the prognosis and precise treatment of cancer.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

A 34-year-old man presented to our department with a complaint of soft pain in the vestibular aspect of left mandibular second premolar and left mandibular first molar.

Upon clinical and radiographical examination, a provisional diagnosis of LPC was made and enucleation of the lesion and histological examination were planned. Histologically, a cystic wall partially lined by a keratinizing squamous epithelium was observed. Surrounding and within the lesion, there was a chronic inflammatory infiltrate also of granulomatous type and with cholesterol clefts. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of odontogenic keratocystic was done. Radiolucent lesions in the premolar and canine region are frequently clinically and radiographically misdiagnosed. The identification of keratocyst in a location preoperatively favoring a lateral periodontal cyst should be suspected and biopsy must be considered in all cases to establish the nature of the lesion, the best surgical treatment, and the follow-up appointments.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Runt-related transcription factors (RUNXs), RUNX1-3, are the master regulators of development and differentiation and are all important to the development of immune cells. However, the role of RUNXs in the immune cells of TME remains unclear. In this study, we first used online related databases and related LGG data from TCGA and CGGA to conduct bioinformatics analysis, which confirmed that RUNXs were significantly and positively correlated with immune infiltration in multiple tumors, especially in low-grade glioma (LGG) and there was the highest correlation between RUNXs and the progress and prognosis of LGG. Furthermore, the functional enrichment analysis revealed that RUNXs might be involved in the inflammatory and immune responses of the biological processes, and RUNXs were tightly associated with the multiple immune checkpoint molecules. Subsequent results confirmed that RUNX1, as an independent prognostic factor for LGG, may target interferon-gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2) to regulate glioma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Besides, we also found that the expression levels of RUNX1 and IFNGR2 were significantly reduced, and their correlation was enhanced in the IDH-mutant subtype. Patients with a high expression of RUNX1 and/or IFNGR2 (HH/H) in the IDH-mutant subtype showed poorer prognosis and significantly increased infiltration of M2 macrophages.

Many studies have shown that TDEs promote lung cancer metastasis and development through multiple mechanisms, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immunosuppression and the formation of a premetastatic niche. TDEs regulate these mechanisms to promote metastasis by carrying DNA, proteins, miRNA, mRNA, lncRNA and ceRNA.

APC mutations result in oncogenic activation of the Wnt pathway, which is associated with hyperproliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and a global increase in mRNA translation. To compensate for the increased biosynthetic demand, cancer cells critically depend on protein chaperones to maintain proteostasis, although their function in CRC remains largely unexplored. In order to investigate the role of molecular chaperones in driving CRC initiation, we captured the transcriptomic profiles of murine wild type and Apc-mutant organoids during active transformation. We discovered a strong transcriptional upregulation of Hspb1, which encodes small heat shock protein 25 (HSP25). We reveal an indispensable role for HSP25 in facilitating Apc-driven transformation, using both in&#160;vitro organoid cultures and mouse models, and demonstrate that chemical inhibition of HSP25 using brivudine reduces the development of premalignant adenomas. These findings uncover a hitherto unknown vulnerability in intestinal transformation that could be exploited for the development of chemopreventive strategies in high-risk individuals.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

Here, we found that long-term metformin exposure led to metabolic adaptation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was characterized by an obvious epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). TOMM34, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated to promote tumor metastasis in response to metformin-induced metabolic stress. Mechanistically, TOMM34 interacted with ATP5B to preserve F<sub>1</sub> F<sub>O</sub> -ATPase activity, which conferred mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production. This metabolic preference for OXPHOS suggested a large requirement of energy supply by cancer cells to survive and spread in response to therapeutic stress. Notably, disturbing the interaction between TOMM34 and ATP5B using Gboxin, a specific OXPHOS inhibitor, increased sensitivity to metformin and suppressed tumor progression both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo. Overall, this study demonstrates a molecular link of the TOMM34/ATP5B-ATP synthesis axis during metformin adaptation and provides promising therapeutic targets for metformin sensitization in cancer treatment.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.

For each cell line, we estimated activity for 49 pathways spanning the entirety of the metabolic network. Upon clustering, we discovered a convergence into only two major metabolic types. These were functionally confirmed by <sup>13</sup> C-flux analysis, lipidomics, and analysis of sensitivity to perturbations. They revealed that the major differences in cancers are associated with lipid, TCA cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism. Thorough integration of these types with multiomics highlighted little association with genetic alterations but a strong association with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

However, the immuno-stimulation induced by PTT alone is insufficient to achieve satisfactory cancer eradication, especially in immunologically \"cold\" tumors due to their harsh immunosuppressive microenvironment. Effective activation of the innate immune system is indispensable to boost a robust adaptive antitumor immune response typically initiated by dendritic cells (DCs).

Among other advantages, these methods are usually praised for delivering a treatment measure that can easily handle multiple outcomes of different nature, while keeping a meaningful interpretation for patients and clinicians. For time-to-event outcomes, a recent suggestion emerged in the literature for estimating these treatment measures by providing a natural handling of censored outcomes. However, this estimation procedure may lead to biased estimates when tails of survival functions cannot be reliably estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimators. The problem then extrapolates to the other outcomes incorporated in the pairwise comparison construction. In this work, we suggest to extend the procedure by the consideration of a hybrid survival function estimator that relies on an extreme value tail model through the Generalized Pareto distribution. We provide an estimator of treatment effect measures that notably improves on bias and remains easily apprehended for practical implementation. This is illustrated in an extensive simulation study as well as in an actual trial of a new cancer immunotherapy.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Here, we report a unique subclass of Notch Independent Hes-1(NIHes-1) expressing Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) in neuroblastoma. These CSCs maintain sustained HES1 expression by activation of HES1 promoter region upstream of classical CBF-1 binding sites thereby, completely bypassing Notch receptor mediated activation. These stem cells have self-renewal ability and potential to generate tumor. Interestingly, we observed that NIHes-1 CSCs could transit to Notch dependent Hes-1 expressing (NDHes-1) CSCs where HES1 is expressed by Notch receptor mediated promoter activation. We observed that NDHes-1 expressing CSCs also had the potential to transit to NIHes-1 CSCs and during this coordinated bidirectional transition, both CSCs gave rise to the majority of the bulk cancer cells, which had HES1 promoter inactive (PIHes-1). A few of these PIHes-1 cells were capable of reverting to a CSC state. These findings explain the existence of heterogenic mode of Hes-1 promoter activation within IMR-32 and the potential to switch between them.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022.

The kinase Kin4, one of the most downstream SPOC components, is essential to stop the mitotic exit network (MEN), a signalling pathway that promotes the exit from mitosis and cell division. Previous work, however, suggested that a Kin4-independent pathway contributes to SPOC, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we established the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (GSK-3) homologue Mck1, as a novel component that works independently of Kin4 to engage SPOC. Our data indicate that both Kin4 and Mck1 work in parallel to counteract MEN activation by the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network. We show that Mck1's function in SPOC is mediated by the pre-replication complex protein and mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (M-Cdk) inhibitor, Cdc6, which is degraded in a Mck1-dependent manner prior to mitosis. Moderate overproduction of Cdc6 phenocopies <i>MCK1</i> deletion and causes SPOC deficiency via its N-terminal, M-Cdk inhibitory domain.

Although&#160;tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is widely used to treat ER-positive breast cancers, resistance to TAM remains a major clinical problem. NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is known to participate in drug metabolism and steroid metabolism. Recent studies showed that high POR expression was correlated with poor outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and POR might be a prognostic biomarker in TNBC. However, the role of POR in TAM resistance is still elusive. In this study, we found that high POR expression was associated with poor prognosis of ER-positive and TAM-treated breast cancer patients. In addition, COX analysis showed that POR expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for ER-positive as well as TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Furthermore, our results suggested that POR overexpression promoted TAM resistance by activating the STAT1/c-Myc pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that high POR/STAT1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Notably, combined treatment with TAM and a specific STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine was more effective for inhibiting TAM-resistant breast cancer cells. Altogether, our findings suggested that POR overexpression induced TAM resistance through STAT1/c-Myc pathway and might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in TAM-treated breast cancer patients.

Recently, GATOR1 (Gap Activity TOward Rags 1) complexes have been shown to play an important role in regulating tumor growth. NPRL2 is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex. Therefore, this study used NPRL2 knockdown to investigate how GATORC1 regulates the prognosis and development of HCC via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy signaling pathways. We established HepG2 cells with NPRL2 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) systems. The siRNA-mediated and shRNA-mediated NPRL2 down-regulation significantly reduced the expression of NPRL2 and two other GATPOR1 complex components, NPRL3 and DEPDC5, in HepG2 cells; furthermore, the efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 protein expression by both the shRNA and siRNA systems enhanced the proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. Additionally, the NPRL2 down-regulation significantly increased HCC growth in the subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. The NPRL2 down-regulation increased the Rag GTPases and mTOR activation and inhibited autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPRL2 level in the tumors was significantly associated with mortality, recurrence, the serum alpha fetoprotein level, the tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Low NPRL2, NPRL3, DEPDC5, and LC3, and high p62 and mTOR protein expression in the tumors was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in 300 patients with HCC after surgical resection. Conclusion: The efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 significantly increased HCC proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro, and increased HCC growth in vivo. Low NPRL2 protein expression in the tumors was closely correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with HCC.

Third, multisite and multimodal assessment of early atherosclerosis is discussed as a way to capture the complexity of atherosclerosis as a systemic disease. In addition to conventional carotid intima-media thickness measurements, the measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and peripheral arterial tonometry can advance the assessment of early atherosclerosis in pediatrics.

In this study, we reinvestigated her brain and spinal cord in more detail. Severe cerebrovascular lesions and cervical spondylotic myelopathy were found to be the main causes of her disability. Although the density of senile plaques was relatively high, the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles was limited. Ghost tangles and argyrophilic grains were mild. The mildness of tau pathological changes in her neurons, in other words the resistance of neurons to tau pathology, may be a factor responsible for her longevity.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>\"]],\n",

Yet most actively-triggerable materials are low-strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long-term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively-triggerable metals, we leveraged a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, we demonstrate that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically-relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, we demonstrate three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively-triggerable metals. This article is protected by copyright.

This strategy has several potential drawbacks, including irregular target delineation for SRS and potential tumor \"seeding\" away from the resection cavity during surgery. A neoadjuvant (preoperative) approach to radiation therapy avoids these limitations and offers improved patient convenience. This study assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant SRS as a new treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">A retrospective review was performed at a single institution to identify patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS (specifically, Gamma Knife radiosurgery) followed by resection of a brain metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate risks of progression and death. Assessments were made of local recurrence and leptomeningeal spread. Additionally, an analysis of the contemporary literature of postoperative and neoadjuvant SRS for metastatic disease was performed.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Twenty-four patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS followed by resection of a brain metastasis were identified in the single-institution cohort. The median age was 64 years (range 32-84 years), and the median follow-up time was 16.5 months (range 1 month to 5.7 years). The median radiation dose was 17 Gy prescribed to the 50% isodose. Rates of local disease control were 100% at 6 months, 87.6% at 12 months, and 73.5% at 24 months. In 4 patients who had local treatment failure, salvage therapy included repeat resection, laser interstitial thermal therapy, or repeat SRS. One hundred thirty patients (including the current cohort) were identified in the literature who had been treated with neoadjuvant SRS prior to resection. Overall rates of local control at 1 year after neoadjuvant SRS treatment ranged from 49% to 91%, and rates of leptomeningeal dissemination from 0% to 16%. In comparison, rates of local control 1 year after postoperative SRS ranged from 27% to 91%, with 7% to 28% developing leptomeningeal disease.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Neoadjuvant SRS for the treatment of brain metastases is a novel approach that mitigates the shortcomings of postoperative SRS.

Imaging demonstrated a mean unidimensional size decrease of 0.2 cm (p = 0.14) and a mean area size decrease of 0.99 cm2 (p = 0.03). Although 88% of the case classifications were concordant and the agreement was significant, WHO criteria were found to be more sensitive to tumor size change.

Though strategies to maximize antitumor T-cell activation are well established, the efficacy of these therapies is limited by an insufficient knowledge of the intricate tumor microenvironment and its capacity to thwart antitumor immunity. Chen and colleagues now uncover a novel immunosuppressive pathway in non-small cell lung carcinoma. Overexpression of cytochrome P450F2 in cancer cells increases production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which instructs the expression of immunosuppressive molecules in cancer-associated fibroblasts by binding the GPR75 receptor and activating STAT3/c-Jun signaling. This work proposes several innovative therapeutic anchor points that may improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapies.

However, the normal-dose CT (NDCT) corresponding to a specific LDCT (it is regareded as the label of the LDCT, which is necessary for supervised learning) are very difficult to obtain. So that the application of supervised learning methods in LDCT reconstruction is limited. It is necessary to construct a unsupervised deep learning framework for LDCT reconstruction that does not depend on paired LDCT-NDCT&#160;datasets.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"METHODS\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We presented an unsupervised learning framework for the transferring from the identity mapping to the low-dose recontruction task, called Marginal Distribution Adaptation in Multi-scale (MDAM). For NDCTs as source domain data, MDAM is an identity map with two parts: firstly, it establishes a dimensionality reduction mapping, which can obtain the same feature distribution from NDCTs and LDCTs; and then NDCTs is retrieved by reconstructing the image overview and details from the low-dimensional features. For the purpose of the feature transfer between source domain and target domain (LDCTs), we introduce the multi-scale feature extraction in the MDAM, and then eliminate differences in probability distributions of these multi-scale features between NDCTs and LDCTs through wavelet decomposition and domain adaptation&#160;learning.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label=\"RESULTS\" NlmCategory=\"RESULTS\">Image quality evaluation metrics and subjective quality scores show that, as an unsupervised method, the performance of the MDAM approaches or even surpasses some state-of-the-art supervised methods.

In contrast, CP/CPPS-derived blood exosomes exhibited molecular properties similar to those of healthy men. Thus, CP/CPPS exhibits molecular changes that constitute a risk for PCa and should be considered in development of PCa biomarkers and cancer screening programmes.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This article is protected by copyright.

Methods After preprocessing of the data from Population Health Data Archive, smuothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) was used to select features. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BP), and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to predict the risk of PCa, among which BP and CNN were used on the enhanced data by SMOTE. The performances of models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving operating characteristic curve. After the optimal model was selected, we used the Shiny to develop an online calculator for PCa risk prediction based on predictive indicators. Results Inorganic phosphorus, triglycerides, and calcium were closely related to PCa in addition to the volume of fragmented tissue and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Among the four models, RF had the best performance in predicting PCa (accuracy: 96.80%; AUC: 0.975, 95% <i>CI</i>: 0.964-0.986). Followed by BP (accuracy: 85.36%; AUC: 0.892, 95% <i>CI</i>: 0.849-0.934) and SVM (accuracy: 82.67%; AUC: 0.824, 95% <i>CI</i>: 0.805-0.844). CNN performed worse (accuracy: 72.37%; AUC: 0.724, 95% <i>CI</i>: 0.670-0.779). An online platform for PCa risk prediction was developed based on the RF model and the predictive indicators. Conclusions This study revealed the application value of traditional machine learning and deep learning models in disease risk prediction under healthcare data platform, proposed new ideas for PCa risk prediction in patients suspected for PCa and had undergone core needle biopsy. Besides, the online calculation may enhance the practicability of AI prediction technology and facilitate medical diagnosis.</AbstractText></Abstract>']],\n",

Nonetheless, reversion mutants (loss of miR-TS inserts) were identified as early as day 35 post-injection in &#8764;40% immunodeficient mice.

The safety and stability of these new miR-CVB3s was verified in immunocompetent mice. Moreover, we showed that these new viruses retained the ability to suppress lung tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, we observed that miR-CVB3 with insertion in P1 region was more stable than miR-CVB3 with preserved length of the 5'UTR, whereas the latter displayed significantly higher oncolytic activity.

To date, no efficient treatment is available for GBC patients. Based on the data from cBioPortal, TIMER, and GDSC, we performed an unbiased screening with 25 candidate compounds that predominantly target ErbB family and identified HKI-272, a highly selective EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, displayed decreased IC<sub>50</sub> values in three GBC cell lines. HKI-272 not only promoted gemcitabine-mediated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and induced cell cycle arrest in GBC, but also enhanced gemcitabine-induced suppressive effects of GBC cell migration and invasion by inhibiting pathways downstream of EGFR. Furthermore, HKI-272, together with gemcitabine, effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastases in mouse models. Immunostaining and HE staining data from both primary tumor and lung metastasis indicated that the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects were mediated through EGFR suppression. Moreover, the expression of EGFR, measured by both immunostaining and HE staining, was correlated with a poor prognosis in GBC. In addition, EGFR in tumor tissues are independent indicators for overall survival in GBC patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that HKI-272 could be a potential therapeutic agent and EGFR might serve as a potential biomarker for patients with GBC.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

These heterogeneous histologic phenotypes originate from tumor cells with the distinct functions of tumorigenesis and self-renewal, called glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs are characterized based on multi-layered epigenetic mechanisms, which control the expression of many genes. This epigenetic regulatory mechanism is often based on functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs have become increasingly important in the pathogenesis of human cancer and work as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to regulate carcinogenesis and progression. These RNAs by being involved in chromatin remodeling and modification, transcriptional regulation, and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, as well as mRNA stability and protein translation, play a key role in tumor development and progression. Numerous studies have been performed to try to understand the dysregulation pattern of these ncRNAs in tumors and cancer stem cells (CSCs), which show robust differentiation and self-regeneration capacity. This review provides recent findings on the role of ncRNAs in glioma development and progression, particularly their effects on CSCs, thus accelerating the clinical implementation of ncRNAs as promising tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>&#169; 2022 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

The dermatofibroma was located on&#160;the buttock, shoulder, and arm, respectively; tumor-related pain had been present for several months to at least a year. The dermal nodules ranged in diameter from 5 millimeters to 12 millimeters and were either flesh-colored to slightly red or brown or tan; one tumor was surrounded by a hyperpigmented patch.

       "  'AbstractText': [[b'<Abstract><AbstractText>In recent times, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been considered one of the major causes of liver disease across the world. NAFLD is defined as the deposition of triglycerides in the liver and is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), fatty liver, hepatocyte injury, unbalanced proinflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, and fibrosis are the main pathogenesis in NAFLD. Recent studies suggest that the action of intestinal microbiota through chronic inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and energy uptake plays a vital role in NAFLD. Moreover, polycystic ovarian syndrome also causes NAFLD development through IR. Age, gender, race, ethnicity, sleep, diet, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic and epigenetic pathways are some contributing factors of NAFLD that can exacerbate the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#160;and eventually lead to death. NAFLD has various presentations, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bloating, upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, poor sleep, increased thirst, palpitation, and a feeling of warmth. Some studies have shown that NAFLD with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has poor outcomes. The gold standard for NAFLD diagnosis is liver biopsy. Other diagnostic tools are imaging tests, serum biomarkers, microbiota markers, and tests for extrahepatic complications. There are no specific treatments for NAFLD. Therefore, the main concern for NAFLD is treating the comorbid conditions such as anti-diabetic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus, statins to reduce HCC progression, antioxidants to prevent hepatocellular damage, and bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI&#160;of &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and &gt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with comorbidities. Lifestyle and dietary changes are considered preventive strategies against NAFLD advancement. Inadequate treatment of NAFLD further leads to cardiac consequences, sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this systematic review, we have briefly discussed the risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical features, and numerous consequences of NAFLD. We have also reviewed various guidelines for NAFLD diagnosis along with existing therapeutic strategies for the management and prevention of the disease.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright &#169; 2022, Zaman et al.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Herein, we report development of a library of benzo[<i>a</i>]quinolizinium-based Au(i) complexes through an intramolecular amino-auration reaction of pyridino-alkynes. We tested 40 candidates and successfully identified BQ-AurIPr as a novel redox-active Au(i) complex with potent anticancer properties. BQ-AurIPr efficiently triggered generation of DAMPs - the hallmarks of ICD - and was superior in terms of efficiency compared to FDA-approved drugs known to induce ICD. BQ-AurIPr significantly increased immunogenicity of cancer cells enhancing their phagocytosis when co-cultured with immune cells. Our investigation reveals that BQ-AurIPr induces oxidative stress inside mitochondria leading to mitophagy, as the mechanism for immunogenic cell death in A549 cells.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>This journal is &#169; The Royal Society of Chemistry.</CopyrightInformation></Abstract>']],\n",

Immunotherapy achieves clinical progress in the treatment of this prevalent malignant disease by virtue of the development of tumor immunology; however, most patients have experienced minimal or no clinical benefit in terms of overall survival. The complexity and diversity of tumor microenvironment (TME) built by immune and stromal cell subsets has been considered to be responsible for the insufficiency of immunotherapy. The advance of bioanalytical technology boosts the exploration of the composition and differentiation of these infiltrated cells, which reflect the immune state of the TME and impact the efficacy of the antitumor immune response. Targeting these cells to remodel the TME is one of the important immunotherapeutic approaches to improve HCC treatment.

Despite typically low toxicity in vertebrates, IMI exposure is associated with liver and gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism underlying IMI toxicity in mammals is unclear. Pesticide exposure frequently activates xenobiotic nuclear receptors, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), to induce detoxification phase I and phase II genes. This study examined the role of CAR in mediating IMI off-target toxicity. Female <i>Car<sup>-/-</sup></i> and wild-type (WT) mice were orally administered imidacloprid (50 mg/kg, twice daily) for 21 days, following which serum, liver, and intestinal tissues were collected. Liver tissue analysis indicated mild inflammation and induction of detoxification gene <i>Cyp2b10</i> in IMI-exposed WT mice. The absence of CAR increased hepatic IMI accumulation. Microbiome analysis of ileal samples revealed IMI altered microbial diversity in a genotype-specific manner, with increased &#945;-diversity in <i>Car<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice while decreased &#945;-diversity in WT mice. We observed <i>Car<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibit intestinal alterations with decreased CYP-P450 expression, blunted villi height, and increased small intestine length and weight independent of IMI exposure. Our results suggest that IMI is not overtly toxic.

In this FSNA, polyA-DNA biosensor was anchored on AuNP surfaces via intrinsic affinity between adenine and Au. The upright conformational polyA-DNA recognition block hybridized with 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled reporter-DNA, resulting in fluorescence quenching of FSNA probes induced by AuNP-based resonance energy transfer. Reporter DNA was replaced in the presence of target miRNA, leading to the recovery of reporter-DNA fluorescence. Subsequently, reporter-DNAs were accumulated and detected in the front of with Nafion membrane in the microchannel by ESA. Our method showed high selectivity and sensitivity with a limit of detection of 1.3 pM. This method could also be used to detect miRNA-21 in human serum and urine samples, with recoveries of 104.0%-113.3% and 104.9%-108.0%, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed a chip with three parallel channels for the simultaneous detection of multiple tumor-related miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-141, and miRNA-375), which increased the detection efficiency.

In this study, a post-targeted screening strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight full information tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS<sup>E</sup>) was developed to identify QYSLD-related xenobiotics in rat urine. The chemical compound database of QYSLD constituents was established from previous research, and metabolites related to these compounds were predicted in combination with their possible metabolic pathways. The metabolites were identified by extracted ion chromatograms using predicted <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values as well as retention time, excimer ions, and fragmentation behavior. Overall, 85 QYSLD-related xenobiotics (20 prototype compounds and 65 metabolites) were characterized from rat urine. The main metabolic reactions and elimination features of QYSLD included oxidation, reduction, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, demethylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, deglycosylation, acetylation, and associated combination reactions. Of the identified molecules, 14 prototype compounds and 58 metabolites were slowly eliminated, thus accumulating in&#160;vivo over an extended period, while five prototypes and two metabolites were present in&#160;vivo for a short duration.
