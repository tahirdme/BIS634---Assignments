The module uses images graded by the ISUP consensus panel consisting of 24 expert uropathologists. Participants graded the same 10 images before and after e-learning. We included those who completed the tests before and after training. We evaluated variation in PCa grading in a fully crossed study design, using linearly weighted kappa values for each pathologist, comparing them to other pathologists and to the ISUP consensus panel. We analysed the improvement in median weighted kappas before and after training, using Wilcoxon's signed rank-test.We included 42 pathologists. Inter-rater reliability between pathologists improved from 0.70 before training to 0.74 after training (p=0.01). When compared with the ISUP consensus panel, five pathologists improved significantly, whereas the kappa of one pathologist was significantly lower after training.

The PD-L1 undergoes multi-level regulations in tumor cells. Among them, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PD-L1 mainly including glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and palmitoylation, have attracted much attention in recent years. These modifications directly affect the stability, cellular localization and function of PD-L1, and subsequently regulate the T cell activation and tumor immunity.

Delays in initiating serious illness conversations, prognostication, and decision-making hindered referral. In contrast, the presence of symptoms facilitated it. (2) Referral was equated to death, and as an inferior form of treatment, a rebranding might mitigate the stigma. (3) Referral made families feel emotional and devastated; explanation and team initiatives enabled the normalisation and positive coping.

PP2A biogenesis is regulated at multiple levels. For example, the sequestration of the free catalytic subunit during the process of biogenesis avoids promiscuous phosphatase activity. Post-translational modifications of PP2A C directs PP2A heterotrimeric formation. Additionally, PP2A functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, where attenuated PP2A enzymatic activity creates a permissive environment for oncogenic transformation. Recent work studying PP2A in cancer showed that its role in tumorigenesis is more nuanced, with some holoenzymes being tumor suppressive, while others are required for oncogenic transformation. In cancer biology, PP2A function is modulated through various mechanisms including the displacement of specific B regulatory subunits by DNA tumor viral antigens, by recurrent mutations, and through loss of carboxymethyl-sensitive heterotrimeric complexes. In aggregate, these alterations bias PP2A activity away from its tumor suppressive functions and towards oncogenic ones. From a therapeutic perspective, molecular glues, and disruptors present opportunities for both the selective stabilization of tumor suppressive holoenzymes and disruption of holoenzymes that are pro-oncogenic.

Previous studies have implicated the deubiquitinase UCHL5 was abnormally expressed in multiple malignancies. However, little was reported about the specific roles of UCHL5 in PAAD. We aimed to identify the biological roles of UCHL5 in PAAD and demonstrate its prognostic significance. Differential analysis revealed that UCHL5 expressed highly in tumors versus normal tissues, like TCGA-PAAD, GSE28735, GSE15471 and collected samples. Patients with high UCHL5 expressions had worse survival outcomes relative to those with low UCHL5 levels. Experimental assays showed that UCHL5 overexpression could significantly enhance cell proliferation, colony formation and self-renewal capacities. UCHL5 could also promote PAAD migration in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, UCHL5 could directly deubiquitinate and stabilize ELK3 proteins. UCHL5 relied on accumulated ELK3 proteins to drive cell growth, stem-like properties and migration abilities. In addition, enrichment analysis based on RNA-seq data implicated that ELK3 mainly correlated with Notch1 signaling and ELK3 could notably elevate ELK3 mRNA levels. UCHL5 could thus promote self-renewal abilities of PAAD and targeting ELK3 could inhibit the stemness features. In contrast, UCHL5 deficiency could suppress PAAD stemness features, and ectopic expression of ELK3 could rescue this effect.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) have crucial roles in all the stages of tumorigenesis and progression. Herein, we explore the DUBs which contribute to aberrant autophagy in ovarian cancer. TCGA data analysis shows that the autophagy level is suppressed, and the selective autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 is abnormally high expressed in ovarian cancer. We screen and identify that the deubiquitinase PSMD14 negatively regulates autophagy level. Functional studies show that increased PSMD14 expression remarkably enhances ovarian cancer cells malignancy, whereas knockdown of PSMD14 has the opposite effect. Furthermore, in vivo assays show that knockdown of PSMD14 inhibits the growth, lung and abdominal metastasis of ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, PSMD14 directly interacts with LRPPRC and inhibits its ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting autophagy through LRPPRC/Beclin1-Bcl-2/SQSTM1 signaling pathway.

The mechanisms underlying pain during CIN are starting to be uncovered. Neuroimaging allows the identification of brain circuitry involved in pain processing and modulation and has recently been used to unravel the disruptions of that circuitry by neuropathic pain. The present study evaluates the effects of paclitaxel, a cytostatic drug frequently used in cancer treatment, at the neuronal function in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus and periaqueductal grey (PAG) using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). We also studied the metabolic profile at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hypothalamus using ex vivo spectroscopy.

The evaluation of mechanical sensitivity using von Frey test at baseline (BL), 21 (T21), 28 (T28), 49 (T49) and 56 days (T56) after CIN induction showed that paclitaxel-injected rats presented mechanical hypersensitivity from T21 until T56 after CIN induction. The evaluation of the locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors using open-field test at T28 and T56 after the first injection of paclitaxel revealed that paclitaxel-injected rats walked higher distance with higher velocity at late point of CIN accompanied with a sustained exhibition of anxiety-like behaviors.

However, a critical bottleneck still lies in exploring simple and controllable methods to synthesize noble metal chalcogenides especially PtS for in vivo photo-induced cancer imaging and simultaneous therapy. Herein, we proposed the albumin-templated synthesis of size-controllable platinum (II) sulfide nanodots (PtS-NDs) for multimodal cancer imaging and potent photothermal therapy. PtS-NDs were precisely synthesized with a tunable size ranging from 2.1 nm to 4.5 nm through a thermodynamically controlled growth inside albumin nanocages. PtS-NDs yielded significant near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and outstanding photothermal conversion under NIR laser irradiation, as well as effective resistance to photobleaching, thereby generating remarkable in vivo photoacoustic signals and distinct hyperthermia at tumor site. Moreover, these nanodots possessed efficient cellular uptake and tumor targeting capabilities in a size-dependent manner, thus leading to controllable diagnostic and thermo-therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, PtS-NDs with core diameter of 4.5 nm displayed preferable in vivo photoacoustic and CT imaging with high sensitivity, spatially and anatomically enhanced imaging contrast, together with hyperthermia mediated tumor ablation.

Here, via engineered extracellular matrices, we observed that the development of mature FAs, coupled with a symmetrical pattern of radial fiber bundles, appeared at the right-angle vertices in cells with square shape. While circular cells aligned the transverse fibers parallel to the cell edge, and moved them centripetally in a counter-clockwise direction, symmetrical bundles of radial fibers at the vertices of square cells disrupted the counter-clockwise swirling and bridged the transverse fibers to move centripetally. In square cells, the contractile force, generated by the myosin IIA-enriched transverse fibers, were concentrated and transmitted outwards along the symmetrical bundles of radial fibers, to the extracellular matrix through FAs, and thereby driving FA organization and maturation. The symmetrical radial fiber bundles concentrated the transverse fibers contractility inward to the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope. The tauter cytoskeletal network adjusted the nuclear-actomyosin force balance to cause nuclear deformability and to increase nuclear translocation of the transcription co-activator YAP, which in turn modulated the switch in MSC commitment. Thus, FAs dynamically respond to geometric cues and remodel actin cytoskeletal network to re-distribute intracelluar tension towards the cell nucleus, and thereby controlling YAP mechanotransduction signaling in regulating MSC fate decision. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We decipher how cellular mechanics is self-organized depending on extracellular geometric features to correlate with mesenchymal stromal cell lineage commitment. In response to geometry constrains on cell morphology, symmetrical radial fiber bundles are assembled and clustered depending on the maturation state of focal adhesions and bridge with the transverse fibers, and thereby establishing the dynamic cytoskeletal network.

Interleukin-11 (IL11), one of the IL6 family cytokines, is highly expressed in various types of cancer including cancers frequently associated with cachexia. However, the impact of IL11 on muscle metabolism remains to be determined. Since one of the mechanisms of muscle wasting in cachexia is defective muscle regeneration due to impaired myogenic differentiation, we examined the effect of IL11 on the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Treatment of C2C12 cells with recombinant mouse IL11 resulted in decreased myotube formation. In addition, IL11 treatment reduced the protein and mRNA levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC), a marker of myogenic differentiation. Moreover, the levels of myogenic regulatory factors including myogenin and Mrf4 were significantly reduced by IL11 treatment. IL11 treatment increased the number of BrdU-positive cells and the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, while the levels of p21Waf1 and p27Kip1 were reduced by IL11 treatment in differentiating C2C12 cells, suggesting that IL11 interferes with cell cycle exit during the early stages of myogenic differentiation.

Age, number of comorbidities, travel time for EBRT, prognostic risk group, and hospital characteristics were associated with EBRT versus prostatectomy in intermediate and high-risk disease.Intermediate/high-risk PCa was increasingly managed with EBRT, while brachy-monotherapy in low/intermediate-risk PCa decreased. In low-risk PCa, the no active treatment-approach increased. Variation in treatment suggests treatment decision related to patient/disease characteristics.

Ubiquitination is a dynamic process that is coordinately regulated by E3 ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs), which have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets. HIF expression and transcriptional activity are usually increased in tumors, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are upregulated in tumors and have multiple effects on HIF signaling and the ubiquitin system. A growing body of evidence has shown that multiple E3 ligases and UBDs function synergistically to control the expression and activity of HIF, thereby allowing cancer cells to cope with the hypoxic microenvironment. Conversely, several E3 ligases and DUBs are regulated by hypoxia and/or HIF signaling. Hypoxia also induces ROS production, which in turn modulates the stability or activity of HIF, E3 ligases, and DUBs. Understanding the complex networks between E3 ligase, DUBS, ROS, and HIF will provide insights into the fundamental mechanism of the cellular response to hypoxia and help identify novel molecular targets for cancer treatment. We review the current knowledge on the comprehensive relationship between E3 ligase, DUBs, ROS, and HIF signaling, with a particular focus on the use of E3 ligase or DUB inhibitors in cancer.", "query": "cancer"}, "36328079": {"ArticleTitle": "Comparative Performance of Artificial Intelligence Optical Diagnosis Systems for Leaving-In-Situ Colorectal Polyps.", "AbstractText": "", "query": "cancer"}, "36328078": {"ArticleTitle": "Engineered upconversion nanocarriers for synergistic breast cancer imaging and therapy: Current state of art.", "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

However, COVID-19 exposed the fragility of planned surgical services around the world, which have also been neglected in pandemic recovery planning. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel index to support local elective surgical system strengthening and address growing backlogs.First, we performed an international consultation through a four-stage consensus process to develop a multidomain index for hospital-level assessment (surgical preparedness index; SPI). Second, we measured surgical preparedness across a global network of hospitals in high-income countries (HICs), middle-income countries (MICs), and low-income countries (LICs) to explore the distribution of the SPI at national, subnational, and hospital levels. Finally, using COVID-19 as an example of an external system shock, we compared hospitals' SPI to their planned surgical volume ratio (SVR; ie, operations for which the decision for surgery was made before hospital admission), calculated as the ratio of the observed surgical volume over a 1-month assessment period between June 6 and Aug 5, 2021, against the expected surgical volume based on hospital administrative data from the same period in 2019 (ie, a pre-pandemic baseline). A linear mixed-effects regression model was used to determine the effect of increasing SPI score.In the first phase, from a longlist of 103 candidate indicators, 23 were prioritised as core indicators of elective surgical system preparedness by 69 clinicians (23 [33%] women; 46 [67%] men; 41 from HICs, 22 from MICs, and six from LICs) from 32 countries. The multidomain SPI included 11 indicators on facilities and consumables, two on staffing, two on prioritisation, and eight on systems. Hospitals were scored from 23 (least prepared) to 115 points (most prepared). In the second phase, surgical preparedness was measured in 1632 hospitals by 4714 clinicians from 119 countries. 745 (45&#183;6%) of 1632 hospitals were in MICs or LICs. The mean SPI score was 84&#183;5 (95% CI 84&#183;1-84&#183;9), which varied between HIC (88&#183;5 [89&#183;0-88&#183;0]), MIC (81&#183;8 [82&#183;5-81&#183;1]), and LIC (66&#183;8 [64&#183;9-68&#183;7]) settings. In the third phase, 1217 (74&#183;6%) hospitals did not maintain their expected SVR during the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 625 (51&#183;4%) were from HIC, 538 (44&#183;2%) from MIC, and 54 (4&#183;4%) from LIC settings. In the mixed-effects model, a 10-point increase in SPI corresponded to a 3&#183;6% (95% CI 3&#183;0-4&#183;1; p<0&#183;0001) increase in SVR. This was consistent in HIC (4&#183;8% [4&#183;1-5&#183;5]; p<0&#183;0001), MIC (2&#183;8 [2&#183;0-3&#183;7]; p<0&#183;0001), and LIC (3&#183;8 [1&#183;3-6&#183;7%]; p<0&#183;0001) settings.The SPI contains 23 indicators that are globally applicable, relevant across different system stressors, vary at a subnational level, and are collectable by front-line teams. In the case study of COVID-19, a higher SPI was associated with an increased planned surgical volume ratio independent of country income status, COVID-19 burden, and hospital type.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that some immune regulatory molecules, such as LGALS9 (coding Galectin-9) and CD48, were expressed in most canine tumors, but other molecules, such as CD274 (coding PD-L1), IL4I1, PVR, TNFSF18, ICOSLG, and TNFSF4, were rarely expressed. NECTIN2 was highly expressed in epithelial tumors but was low in non-epithelial tumors. In contrast, VSIR and CD200 expressions were low in epithelial tumors but high in non-epithelial tumors. Interestingly, several tumors expressed distinctive immunoregulatory factors. Hepatocellular carcinomas expressed FGL1, mast cell tumors expressed PDCD1LG2 (coding PD-L2), transitional cell carcinomas expressed VTCN1 (coding B7x), and lymphomas and squamous cell carcinomas expressed CD70.

In this context, dealing with MIPs synthesis for bio-macromolecules detection/extraction, one of the critical steps in ensuring effective binding affinity for the parent molecule is the selection of suitable epitopes for pCAs imprinting. To address this challenge, here we investigated the ability of lysine (K) residues to trigger the epitope imprinting process into a polynorepinephrine (PNE) matrix. To this aim, we first designed a set of model epitopes composed of three K and six alanine (A) residues to investigate the influence of each 'KA' combination on the imprinting process and the resulting binding performance by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Only the case of three flanking K residues in N-terminus arose as an excellent trigger for epitope imprinting. The efficacy of the 3K-tag strategy was then evaluated on two peptide templates belonging to soluble programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1), which is of great interest as a cancer biomarker in liquid biopsies. These templates were selected due to their negligible natural ability to be imprinted into the PNE matrix and were modified with 3K-tags, in N-, C-, and N/C- positions, respectively.

Exploring the molecular processes underlying the formation and progression of GBM, as well as identifying novel therapeutic targets, is critical for improving GBM therapy and prognosis.We extracted primary GSCs (glioblastoma stem cells) from patient-derived samples. Different levels of CSNK1D were evaluated through immunohistochemistry, western blot and real-time PCR assays. A Transwell assay was used to detect invasive ability of cell lines. Tumorsphere formation assay was performed to detect cancer stemness properties. Orthotopic xenograft models were used to evaluate the effect of CSNK1D on GSC tumorigenesis.We found the expression levels of CSNK1D was elevated in GBM tissues compared with normal brain. CSNK1D expression had an increased tendency among WHO grades (G2-G4), and was higher in IDH wildtype group than in mutation group. The prognosis of the CSNK1D high expression group was significantly worse than that of the low expression group. Cox multivariate analysis showed that CSNK1D was also an independent prognostic factor in GBM patients. In primary GBM cells, we observed increased levels of CSNK1D in GSCs compared to non-stem tumor cells (NSTCs). In addition, the change of stemness markers expression and proliferation of GSCs were in coordinate with CSNK1D overexpression or knockdown. Furthermore, CSNK1D could affect the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and MMPs expression in GSCs. Finally, disruption of CSNK1D expression impairs GSC survival and GBM tumor propagation in orthotopic xenograft models.Our results suggest that CSNK1D correlated with GBM prognosis and might influence the stemness and invasiveness of GSCs, which represented a potential therapeutic target in GBM patients.", "query": "cancer"}, "36327820": {"ArticleTitle": "The spectrum of intestinal mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms in a tertiary center in Taiwan with a high frequency of perforation.", "AbstractText": "Primary intestinal T-cell lymphomas (PITLs) comprise enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and intestinal T cell lymphoma, NOS (ITCL-NOS).

A positive correlation between SCNN1G and CDH1 expression was observed, which suggested that SCNN1G might impede HNSCC metastasis via strengthing cell-cell adherin. In addition, RAS signaling and ion channel transport signaling were enriched by SCNN1G in HNSCC using GSEA analysis, indicating that these signaling pathways might be the underlying mechanisms for SCNN1G as well.

The development of data-driven models for CRD and subtyping on whole-slide images&#160;(WSIs) would mitigate the burden of pathologists and improve their accuracy in diagnosis. However, the existing models are facing two major limitations. Firstly, they typically require large-scale datasets with precise annotations, which contradicts with the original intention of reducing labor effort. Secondly, for the subtyping task, the non-cancerous regions are treated as the same as cancerous regions within a WSI, which confuses a subtyping model in its training process. To tackle the latter limitation, the previous research proposed to perform CRD first for ruling out the non-cancerous region, then train a subtyping model based on the remaining cancerous patches. However, separately training ignores the interaction of these two tasks, also leads to propagating the error of the CRD task to the subtyping task. To address these issues and concurrently improve the performance on both CRD and subtyping tasks, we propose a semi-supervised multi-task learning&#160;(MTL) framework for cancer classification. Our framework consists of a backbone feature extractor, two task-specific classifiers, and a weight control mechanism. The backbone feature extractor is shared by two task-specific classifiers, such that the interaction of CRD and subtyping tasks can be captured. The weight control mechanism preserves the sequential relationship of these two tasks and guarantees the error back-propagation from the subtyping task to the CRD task under the MTL framework. We train the overall framework in a semi-supervised setting, where datasets only involve small quantities of annotations produced by our minimal point-based&#160;(min-point) annotation strategy.

Analysis revealed how socio-contextual factors originating outside of residential facilities were dominant influences on \"downstream\" working conditions, worker health, staff turnover, and by extension, client care. Four primary socio-contextual themes surfaced:1) Changes in type and potency of substances and client need not reliably accompanied by shifts in treatment practices; 2) challenges balancing state requirements and state-provided resources; 3) influence of structural discrimination and addiction stigma on pay and professional advancement; and 4) geographic location of facilities shape work and quality of life.

Findings indicate that protecting health and wellbeing of providers-many of whom are in addiction recovery themselves- is integral to improving addiction treatment.

To include children in the design of interventions is rare and dependent on the parents giving consent to participation in research on their children's behalf. The aim was to illuminate, from the parents' perspective, the experience of their children being part in the co-creation of a serious game and their previous experiences of RT.Ten parents of children taking part in a participatory action research study of the development of a serious game were invited to an interview and seven parents consented. An inductive, manifest content analysis was performed.The analysis resulted in an overarching theme: Parents' pre-understanding from their child's cancer treatment created a sensitivity to their child's wishes and a willingness to contribute to science. Four categories are presented: Intrinsic factors influenced the intent to participate, Extrinsic factors that had an effect on participation, Parents role in the game development, and Radiotherapy impinged the child and the parent.To be able to pay it forward to healthcare and other families with a child diagnosed with cancer was a contributing factor for parents' willingness to consent to participation after their children had undergone RT, especially since their children wanted to do so. Parents indicated interest in the developmental process and in following their children being part of the creation of a serious game about RT.To understand why parents allow their children to participate in studies creates opportunities for the research community to structure studies that facilitate participation.", "query": "cancer"}, "36327517": {"ArticleTitle": "Women's experiences of information, education and support when undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer: An exploratory qualitative study.", "AbstractText": "As cancer survival rates increase, so does the importance of preventing and alleviating the late effects of radiotherapy.

The structure of C1 and C2 was confirmed by elemental analysis, FTIR, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. Complex C1 crystallizes as binuclear where two Cu (II) ions are bridged by four acetate ligands while C2 is a mononuclear complex with twisted octahedral geometry.

Without accurate and comparable data on Tumour stage at diagnosis, it is difficult to define the reasons for these survival differences. This is because measurement systems designed for adult cancers do not apply to children's cancers and cancer registries often hold limited information on paediatric tumour stage and the data sources used to define it.The BENCHISTA project aims to test the application of the international consensus \"Toronto Staging Guidelines\" (TG) for paediatric tumours by European and non-European PBCRs for six common paediatric solid tumours so that reliable comparisons of stage at diagnosis and survival rates by stage can be made to understand any differences. A secondary aim is to test the data availability and completeness of collection of several 'Toronto' consensus non-stage prognostic factors, treatment types given, occurrence of relapse/progression and cause of death as a descriptive feasibility study.PBCRs will use their permitted data access channels to apply the Toronto staging guidelines to all incident cases of six solid childhood cancers (medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewings sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumour) diagnosed in a consecutive three-year period within 2014-2017 in their population. Each registry will provide a de-identified patient-level dataset including tumour stage at diagnosis, with only the contributing registry holding the information that would be needed to re-identify the patients. Where available to the registry, patient-level data on 'Toronto' non-stage prognostic factors, treatments given and clinical outcomes (relapse/progression/cause of death) will be included. More than 60 PBCRs have been involved in defining the patient-level dataset items and intend to participate by contributing their population-level data. Tumour-specific on-line training workshops with clinical experts are available to cancer registry staff to assist them in applying the Toronto staging guidelines in a consistent manner. There is also a project-specific help desk for discussion of difficult cases and promotion of the CanStaging online tools, developed through the International Association of Cancer Registries, to further ensure standardisation of data collection.

Therefore, this project can be seen as a feasibility project of widespread use of Toronto Staging at a population-level by cancer registries, specifying the data sources used and testing how well standardized the processes can be. Variation in tumour stage distribution could be due to real differences, to different diagnostic practices between countries and/or to variability in how cancer registries assign Toronto stage.

The cancerous cells and their corresponding normal cells are both considered to be liquid cells each with their unique refractive index (RI). Normally these cells are found in liquid form in the suitable media (food) required to live the cancerous/normal cell lines. Also in our detection case, liquid samples are easy to pump into the sensing channel of the proposed PCF by employing either pressure or capillary forces.The proposed PCF sensor works on the SPR principle, with the Au coating serving as the plasmonic material. This sensor is investigated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software computational tool that is based on the full-vector finite element method (FEM). A TiO2 coating has been applied to enhance adhesion between the Au layer and the PCF surface. Above the Au coating, cancerous cells samples are filled into the PCF. When the core mode of the PCF is coupled with the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode under the specific resonance circumstances, SPR will occur on the interface of the gold-sample cell, and in the core mode, the loss peak is observed at the resonance wavelength. Cancerous cells samples have a distinct loss peak than normal cells samples therefore the cancerous cells can be diagnosed by measuring the shift in resonance wavelength corresponding to the loss peak of cancerous and their normal cells samples. The proposed sensor may identify various cancerous cells such as MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat for the diagnosis of breast cancer type-1, breast cancer type-2, adrenal glands, cervical, and blood cancer respectively. The computed wavelengths sensitivities of the proposed PCF are 9428.57 nm/RIU, 10714.28 nm/RIU, 7571.43 nm/RIU, 5500 nm/RIU, and 6000 nm/RIU for the MDAMB-231, MCF-7, PC12, HeLa, and Jurkat cancerous cells, respectively.

We further incorporate lesion segmentation network into our framework to exploit lesion-level features for effective cancer classification in the whole CT volumes. The proposed framework is based on fully 3D convolutional neural networks to jointly optimize both synthesis and classification of 3D CT volumes. Exten- sive experiments on both in-house and external datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for the diagnosis with incomplete data compared with state-of-the- art baselines.

We used conditional Cre-LoxP mice to investigate how specific loss of BMPR1A in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts/smooth muscle cells affects intestinal homeostasis. Selective loss of BMPR1A in fibroblasts causes severe histological changes in the intestines with a significant increase in stromal cell content and epithelial cell hyperproliferation, leading to numerous serrated polyps.

The possible risk factors for postoperative esophageal strictures were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Eventually, a risk-scoring model was built, in which 70% of patients were used to develop the model and the remaining 30% were used for validation.A total of 553 patients who received ESD were involved, and the incidence of esophageal strictures after ESD was 16.6% (92/553). In our study, the operating time, circumferential range, lesion location, depth of infiltration, and R0 resection were independent risk factors for esophageal strictures after ESD. According to the risk of postoperative esophageal stenosis, a risk-scoring model for esophageal strictures prediction was developed. The risk score ranged from 0 to 11 points, and the risk scores were divided into low risk (0-3 points), intermediate risk (4-7 points), and high risk (8-11 points). The proportions of esophageal stenosis progression in the corresponding risk categories were 6.33%, 29.14%, and 100%.We developed a risk-scoring model based on factors including circumferential range, lesion location, depth of infiltration, and R0 resection.

Combined radiotherapy (RT) and immunotherapy (IT) treatment improved survival for a subset of patients with inflamed tumors or tumors susceptible to RT-induced inflammation. To overcome radioresistance and improve treatment outcomes, an understanding of factors that suppress anti-tumor immunity is necessary. In this regard, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical mediators of immune suppression in HNSCCs. In this study, we investigated how radiation modulates Treg infiltration in tumors through the chemokine CCL20. We hypothesized that radiation induces CCL20 secretion resulting in Treg infiltration and suppression of anti-tumor immunity.&#160;Human and mouse HNSCC cell lines with different immune phenotypes were irradiated at doses of 2 or 10&#160;Gy. Conditioned media, RNA and protein were collected for assessment of CCL20. qPCR was used to determine CCL20 gene expression.&#160;In vivo, MOC2 cells were implanted into the buccal cavity of mice and the effect of neutralizing CCL20 antibody was determined alone and in combination with RT. Blood samples were collected before and after RT for analysis of CCL20. Tumor samples were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine immune infiltrates, including CD8 T cells and Tregs. Mass-spectrometry was performed to analyze proteomic changes in the tumor microenvironment after anti-CCL20 treatment.&#160;Cal27 and MOC2 HNSCCs had a gene signature associated with Treg infiltration, whereas SCC9 and MOC1 tumors displayed a gene signature associated with an inflamed TME.&#160;In vitro, tumor irradiation at 10&#160;Gy significantly induced CCL20 in Cal27 and MOC2 cells relative to control. The increase in CCL20 was associated with increased Treg migration. Neutralization of CCL20 reversed radiation-induced migration of Treg cells in vitro and decreased intratumoral Tregs in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of CCL20 resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth compared to control in MOC2 tumors. This effect was further enhanced after combination with RT compared to either treatment alone.&#160;Our results suggest that radiation promotes CCL20 secretion by tumor cells which is responsible for the attraction of Tregs.

DNA fragment sizes in the contrived reference samples were similar to those found within patient plasma-derived cell-free DNA, and mutational patterns aligned with those in the parental tumor lines. For the 7, 20, and 26 mut/Mb contrived reference samples with 2% tumor content, bTMB scores estimated using either assay aligned with expected scores from the parental tumor cell lines and showed good reproducibility. A bioinformatic filtration step was required to account for low VAF artefact variants. We demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of producing and using bTMB reference standards across a range of bTMB levels, and how such standards could support the calibration and validation of bTMB platforms and help harmonization between panels and laboratories.

The mechanisms underlying the increase in YAP expression and transcriptional activity in PKD remain obscure. We observed that in kidneys from mice with juvenile cystic kidney (jck) ciliopathy, the aberrant hyperactivity of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) driven by ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT cascades induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteotoxic stress. To reduce it by reprogramming translation, the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2&#945; (eIF2&#945;) arm of the integrated stress response (ISR) was activated. PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; drove the selective translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), potentiating YAP expression. In parallel, YAP underwent K63-linked polyubiquitination by SCF-S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) E3 ubiquitin ligase, a Hippo-independent, nonproteolytic ubiquitination that enhances YAP nuclear trafficking and transcriptional activity in cancer cells. Defective ISR cellular adaptation to ER stress in eIF2&#945;-phosphorylation-deficient jck mice further augmented YAP-mediated transcriptional activity and renal cyst growth. Conversely, pharmacological tuning down of ER stress-ISR activity and SKP2 expression in jck mice by administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) or tolvaptan, impeded these processes. Restoring ER homeostasis, and/or interfering with the SKP2-YAP interaction represent novel potential therapeutic avenues for stemming the progression of renal cystogenesis.", "query": "cancer"}, "36326808": {"ArticleTitle": "Diametrical Effects of Glucose Levels on Microvascular Permeability of Peripheral Nerves in Type 2 Diabetes Patients With and Without Diabetic Neuropathy.", "AbstractText": "Clinical studies investigating the benefit of glucose control on the progression of diabetic neuropathy (DN) have come to controversial results in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

While PTT induces the ablation of solid tumors, its efficiency is hampered by self-recovery within impaired cancer cells through glycolysis and respiration metabolism. Based on this, the introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-mediated respiration inhibition is a good choice to make up for the PTT limitation. Herein, nanovesicles (NP1) are integrated by a hypoxia-responsive conjugated polymer (P1), polymetric H2S donor (P2), and near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting aza-BODIPY dye (B1) for the delivery of H2S and synergistic H2S gas therapy/PTT. The scaffold of NP1 undergoes disassembly in the hypoxic environments, thus triggering the hydrolysis of P2 to continuously long-term release H2S. Dependent on the superior photothermal ability of B1, NP1 elicits high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951; = 19.9%) under NIR light irradiation for PTT. Moreover, NP1 serves as in situ H2S bombers in the hypoxic tumor environment and suppresses the mitochondrial respiration through inhibiting expression of cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) and cutting off the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation.

A total of 13&#8239;532 US patients received first-line chemotherapy, and 2137 received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy. Of those, 8447 patients (62.4%) in the first-line chemotherapy group and 1653 patients (77.3%) in the first-line pembrolizumab group had complete data on baseline covariates for outcome model estimation. A total of 1476 Canadian patients who received first-line chemotherapy and 287 patients who received first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy were identified from the target population. After standardization to baseline patient covariates in the Canadian cohorts, transported OS estimates revealed a less than 5% mean absolute difference from the observed OS in the target population (0.56% over 60 months of follow-up in the first-line chemotherapy group and 4.54% over 30 months of follow-up in the first-line pembrolizumab group). Negative control analysis using a mismatched outcome model revealed a 6.64% discrepancy and an incompatible survival curve shape. The results were robust to assumptions of random missingness for baseline covariates, to unadjusted differences in baseline metastases and comorbidities, and to differences in the standard of care between the US and Canada related to administration of second-line anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 immunotherapy for patients who initiated first-line chemotherapy.The results of this cohort study suggest that, under specific circumstances, OS estimates from US clinical practice data can be adjusted using baseline clinical characteristics to closely approximate OS in selected groups of Canadian patients with advanced NSCLC.

Secondarily, to examine differences in risk of fracture stratified by modifiable behaviors, treatment, and cancer type.This longitudinal cohort study used data from 92&#8239;431 older adults in the US Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort linked with 1999 to 2017 Medicare claims. Data were analyzed from July 15, 2021, to May 3, 2022.Cancer history, time since cancer diagnosis, and stage at cancer diagnosis.Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the risk of pelvic, radial, vertebral, and total frailty-related fractures were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Stratification was used for secondary aims.Among 92&#8239;431 participants (mean [SD] age, was 69.4 [6.0] years, 51&#8239;820 [56%] women, and 90&#8239;458 [97.9%] White], 12&#8239;943 participants experienced a frailty-related bone fracture. Compared with participants without a history of cancer, cancer survivors who were diagnosed 1 to less than 5 years earlier with advanced stage cancer had higher risk of fracture (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.75-2.58). The higher fracture risk in cancer survivors with recent advanced stage diagnosis (vs no cancer) was driven largely by vertebral (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.93-3.13) and pelvic (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.84-3.29) fracture sites. Compared with cancer survivors who did not receive chemotherapy, survivors who received chemotherapy were more likely to have a fracture; this association was stronger within 5 years of diagnosis (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.57) than 5 or more years after diagnosis (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99-1.51). Although the HR for risk of fracture was lower among physically active cancer survivors 5 or more years after diagnosis (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54-1.07), this result was not statistically significant, whereas current smoking was significantly associated with higher risk of fracture (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.55-3.33).Findings from this cohort study suggest that older adults with a history of cancer may benefit from clinical guidance on prevention of frailty-related fractures.

These enzymes add neutral moieties, such as aminoarabinose (AraN) and ethanolamine (EtN) to lipid A terminal phosphates that mask the phosphate's negative charge and inhibit electrostatic interaction with the cationic polymyxins. Currently, these modifications may be detected by MALDI-TOF MS; however, this analysis is only semiquantitative. Herein we describe a GC-MS method to quantitate lipid A backbone components, glucosamine (GlcN) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), along with terminal phosphate modifications AraN and EtN. In this assay, lipid A is isolated from Gram-negative bacterial samples, hydrolyzed into its individual moieties, and derivatized via methoximation followed by silylation prior to analysis via GC-MS. Changes in AraN and EtN quantity were characterized using a variety of regulatory mutants of Salmonella, revealing differences that were not detected using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Additionally, an increase in the abundance of AraN and EtN modifications were observed when resistant Enterobacter and Escherichia coli strains were grown in the presence of colistin (polymyxin E). Lastly, increased levels of Pi were found in bisphosphorylated lipid A compared to monophosphorylated lipid A samples.

While the previous meta-analysis suggests that estrogen receptor (ESR) genetic polymorphisms are closely associated with dementia, the implications of this observation on a molecular level are not entirely understood. Our study explores this intricate molecular puzzle through the use of a variety of bioinformatics tools. Initially, we attempted to elucidate mechanisms underlying breast cancer development by identifying the high-throughput dataset of ESR1-knockdown breast cancer tissue samples. Surprisingly, KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the most frequently occurring proteins were related to axonal guidance and inflammation-related gene markers. These observations were supported by an external high throughput dataset of AD inflammatory samples in vivo. Our results suggest that ESR1 is modulated by apolipoprotein E (APOE) through CEBPB/ATF4, mir-155-5p, or mir-1-3p. Moreover, sea hare-hydrolysates (SHH), as one of the axonal guidance molecules, could regulate the STAT3/PRDM1/CEBPB pathway and consequently induce cell death through pyroptosis signaling pathways, trigger the secretion of IL1&#946;, leading to neuroinflammation and worsening AD pathogenesis.

A pooled IL-6 Mean Difference (MD) of 41&#160;pg/mL for malignant tumors compared to benign ones, with a Confidence Interval (CI) between 19.8 and 62.2, a Z-score of 3.79, and statistical significance with a p&#160;=&#160;0.0002 was observed. Pooled results for healthy versus benign ovarian conditions showed an MD of 5.45&#160;pg/mL for serum or plasma IL-6 measurements in favor of benign tumors (CI:0.66-10.25, Z&#160;=&#160;2.23 and p&#160;=&#160;0.03).

Ionizing radiation (IR) promotes PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. However, the effect of IR on macrophage PD-L1 expression and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. ATM kinase, as the key kinase for initiating DNA damage repair (DDR) process, is associated with innate immune STING axis activation. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism implicated in macrophage PD-L1 expression regulated by IR as well as the role of ATM kinase in this process.IR-regulated PD-L1 expression in macrophages and associated signaling pathways were explored by in vitro studies using murine and human macrophage cell lines. A colorectal xenograft murine model was employed to demonstrate the impact of targeting ATM and PD-L1 expression in TAM following IR on growth of tumor in vivo.IR up-regulated PD-L1 expression in macrophages, which was further augmented by ATM kinase inhibition. ATM inhibition increased IR-induced DNA damage, which activated STING/interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling pathway and up-regulated type I interferon (IFN-I) expression in macrophages. IFN-I bound to the IFN &#945; receptor 1 on macrophages, activated the downstream JAK1 and STAT1/3 signaling and eventually led to PD-L1 up-expression. ATM inhibition augmented IR-induced PD-L1 expression in macrophages and CD8+ T cell infiltration, and promoted anti-tumor efficacy in vivo.These results suggested that ATM inhibition promoted IR-induced PD-L1 expression through the activation of innate immunity in TAM, which provided a novel approach to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of RT.

In vitro results showed that the HS15-Myr nanomicelles enhanced the antioxidant activity of myricetin (Myr) and inhibited cisplatin-induced proliferation inhibition of HK-2 cells. Moreover, the HS15-Myr nanomicelles inhibited cisplatin-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduction, and DNA damage, which might be related to the inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)&#9472;stimulating interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway. In vivo results in mice showed that the significant reductions in body weight and renal indices and the increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels induced by cisplatin could be significantly reversed by pretreating with the HS15-Myr nanomicelles. Furthermore, nanomicelle pretreatment significantly altered the activities of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., GSH, MDA, and SOD) induced by cisplatin. In addition, cisplatin-induced inflammatory responses in mouse kidney tissue were found to be inhibited by pretreatment with HS15-Myr nanomicelles, such as IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945; expression.

Through this motif, HPV E6 targets a large number of cellular substrates, many of which are involved in processes related to the regulation of cell polarity. Recent studies also demonstrated E6's PDZ binding motif (PBM)-dependent association with SNX27, with a potential role in the perturbation of endocytic transport. Here, we have performed a proteomic analysis to identify SNX27-interacting partners whose binding to SNX27 is specifically perturbed in an E6-dependent manner. Extracts of HeLa cells that express GFP-tagged SNX27, transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting E6AP, were subject to GFP immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectroscopy, which identified TANC2 as an interacting partner of SNX27. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HPV E6 inhibits association between SNX27 and TANC2 in a PBM-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in TANC2 protein levels. In the absence of E6, SNX27 directs TANC2 toward lysosomal degradation. TANC2, in the presence of HPV-18E6, enhances cell proliferation in a PBM-dependent manner, indicating that HPV E6 targets the SNX27-mediated transport of TANC2 to promote cellular proliferation. IMPORTANCE While a great deal is known about the role of the E6 PDZ binding motif (PBM) in modulating the cellular proteins involved in regulating cell polarity, much less is known about the consequences of E6's interactions with SNX27 and the endocytic sorting machinery. We reasoned that a potential consequence of such interactions could be to affect the fate of multiple SNX27 endosomal partners, such as transmembrane proteins or soluble accessory proteins. Using a proteomic approach in HPV-18-positive cervical tumor-derived cells, we demonstrate that TANC2 is an interacting partner of SNX27, whose interaction is blocked by E6 in a PBM-dependent manner. This study therefore begins to shed new light on how E6 can regulate the endocytic transport of multiple SNX27-binding proteins, thereby expanding our understanding of the functions of the E6 PBM.", "query": "cancer"}, "36326270": {"ArticleTitle": "Enhanced Fusobacterium nucleatum Genetics Using Host DNA Methyltransferases To Bypass Restriction-Modification Systems.", "AbstractText": "Bacterial restriction-modification (R-M) systems are a first-line immune defense against foreign DNA from viruses and other bacteria. While R-M systems are critical in maintaining genome integrity, R-M nucleases unfortunately present significant barriers to targeted genetic modification. Bacteria of the genus Fusobacterium are oral, Gram-negative, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens that are implicated in the progression and severity of multiple cancers and tissue infections, yet our understanding of their direct roles in disease have been severely hindered by their genetic recalcitrance. Here, we demonstrate a path to overcome these barriers in Fusobacterium by using native DNA methylation as a host mimicry strategy to bypass R-M system cleavage of transformed plasmid DNA. We report the identification, characterization, and successful use of Fusobacterium nucleatum type II and III DNA methyltransferase (MTase) enzymes to produce a multifold increase in gene knockout efficiency in the strain Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum 23726, as well as the first system for efficient gene knockouts and complementations in F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum 25586. We show plasmid protection can be accomplished in vitro with purified enzymes, as well as in vivo in an Escherichia coli host that constitutively expresses F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum MTase enzymes. In summary, this proof-of-concept study characterizes specific MTases that are critical for bypassing R-M systems and has enhanced our understanding of enzyme combinations that could be used to genetically modify clinical isolates of Fusobacterium that have thus far been inaccessible to molecular characterization.

The etiology of CH and early SH in DS remains unclear. Previous research has shown genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in DS. Thus, we hypothesized that CH and early SH could be caused by epigenetically driven transcriptional downregulation of thyroid-related genes, through promoter region hypermethylation.We extracted whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of DS and non-DS individuals from four independent Illumina array-based datasets (252 DS individuals and 519 non-DS individuals). The data were divided in a discovery and validation dataset. Epigenome-wide association analysis was performed using a linear regression model, after which we filtered for thyroid-related genes.In the discovery dataset, we identified significant associations for DS in 18 thyroid-related genes. 21 of 30 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were also significant in the validation dataset. A meta-analysis of the discovery and validation datasets detected 31 DMPs, including 29 promoter-associated CpGs with identical direction of effect across the datasets, and two differentially methylated regions (DMRs). 27 DMPs were hypomethylated and promoter-associated. The mean methylation difference of hypomethylated thyroid-related DMPs decreased with age.Contrary to our hypothesis of generalized hypermethylation of promoter regions of thyroid-related genes - indicative of epigenetic silencing of promoters and subsequent transcriptional downregulation, causing the biochemical thyroid abnormalities in DS -, we found an enrichment of hypomethylated DMPs annotated to promoter regions of these genes. This suggests that CH and early SH in DS are not caused by differential methylation of thyroid-related genes. Considering epigenetic regulation is dynamic, we hypothesize the observed thyroid-related gene DNAm changes could be a rescue phenomenon in an attempt to ameliorate the thyroid phenotype, through epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes. This hypothesis is supported by the finding of decreasing methylation difference of thyroid-related genes with age. The prevalence of early SH declines with age, so hypothetically, epigenetic upregulation of thyroid-related genes also diminishes.

Both PTH-dependent and PTH-independent mechanisms have been shown to lead to hypocalcemia in the present cohort. Moreover, osteoporosis and gastrointestinal side effects could be considered as predisposing conditions, though further studies are needed to get more insights into other possible risk factors to monitor.

New approaches are being developed to improve the binding affinity and specificity of existing approaches and to develop peptide agents as potentially useful drugs. We also highlight the key challenges that must be overcome in peptide drug development to realize their potential and provide an overview of recent trends in peptide drug development. In addition, we take an in-depth look at early efforts in human hormone discovery, smart medicinal chemistry and design, natural peptide drugs, and breakthrough advances in molecular biology and peptide chemistry.", "query": "cancer"}, "36326180": {"ArticleTitle": "Machine learning to improve prognosis prediction of metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma treated with cytoreductive nephrectomy and systemic therapy.", "AbstractText": "Cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) combined with systemic therapy is commonly used to treat metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC).

In the present study, the clinical data of 782 mccRCC patients who received both CN and systemic therapy were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2016), and patients were divided into training and internal test cohorts. A total of 144 patients who met the same criteria from our center (Peking Union Medical College Hospital) were placed in the external test cohort. The cancer-specific survival rate (CSS) at 1, 3, and 5 years was set as the research outcome. Then, four ML models, i.e., a gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR), were established. Fifteen potential independent features were included in this study.&#160; Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Seven clinical features, namely pathological grade, T stage, N stage, number of metastatic sites, brain or liver metastases, and metastasectomy were selected for subsequent analysis via the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. In conclusion, the GBM model performed best at 1-, 3- and 5-year CSS prediction (0.836, 0.819 and 0.808, respectively in the internal test cohort and 0.819, 0.805 and 0.786, respectively in the external cohort).

Surgeons who had recently used telehealth were less likely to endorse most barriers. Younger age, awareness of Medicare telehealth reimbursement and working in neurosurgery, urology, paediatric surgery and plastic and reconstructive surgery (compared to general surgery) were associated with recent telehealth use by surgeons.Some surgeons' perceived barriers to telehealth pre-COVID may be overcome by COVID-19-related telehealth uptake and familiarisation.

In this context, redox imbalance is an undervalued characteristic of cancer. However, it may be targeted by boron- and phosphorus-containing materials to selectively or systemically fight cancer. In particular, boron and phosphorus derivatives are attractive building blocks for rational drug discovery due to their unique and wide regioselective chemistry, high degree of tuneability and chemical stability. Thus, they can be meticulously employed to access tunable molecular platforms to selectively exploit the redox imbalance of cancer cells towards necrosis/apoptosis. This field of research holds a remarkable potential; nevertheless, it is still in its infancy.

The internal chemical modification of the target RNA at a specific site is a basic feature of epitranscriptomics and is critical for its structural stability and functional property. More than 170 modifications at the transcriptomic level have been reported so far, among which m6A methylation is one of the more conserved internal RNA modifications, abundantly found in eukaryotic mRNAs and frequently involved in enhancing the target messenger RNA's (mRNA) stability and translation. m6A modification of mRNAs is essential for multiple physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, nervous system development and gametogenesis. Any aberration in the m6A modification can often result in a pathological condition. The deregulation of m6A methylation has already been described in inflammation, viral infection, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The m6A modification is reversible in nature and is carried out by specialized m6A proteins including writers (m6A methyltransferases) that add methyl groups and erasers (m6A demethylases) that remove methyl groups selectively. The fate of m6A-modified mRNA is heavily reliant on the various m6A-binding proteins (\"readers\") which recognize and generate a functional signal from m6A-modified mRNA.

In addition, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses of IAC patients to screen for relevant variables (driver genes and clinicopathological features) affecting their prognosis.Ultimately, 759 patients with LUAD were enrolled, including 135, 130, and 494 cases of AIS, MIA, and IAC, respectively. EGFR mutations were identified in 359 (61.8%) patients, and with the transition from AIS to MIA, the frequency of EGFR mutations increased from 33.3% to 50.8%, p&#160;=&#160;0.004, whereas the frequency of EGFR mutations was comparable for MIA and IAC (50.8% vs. 50.2%, p&#160;=&#160;0.922). Moreover, ALK and ROS1 gene fusions were identified in 17 cases (2.2%) and 2 cases (3.0&#8240;) respectively. For AIS, neither ALK gene nor ROS1 gene fusions were observed. When the tumour progressed to MIA, the ALK fusion frequency was 2.3% (3/130), which was basically consistent with the ALK fusion frequency of 2.8% in IAC, p&#160;=&#160;0.143. For IAC, fusions of ROS1 fell into this category. In addition, we found that 40 patients (5.3%) developed metastasis/recurrence, and 14 patients (1.8%) died of cancer-specific related diseases. Notably, for AIS, there were no recurrences and no deaths, and for MIA, only 1 patient died with LUAD. Finally, survival analysis was performed in patients with stage IA invasive adenocarcinoma, and EGFR-mutant patients showed better DFS than EGFR-wild-type patients (p&#160;=&#160;0.036). Conversely, patients with ALK fusions showed worse DFS than those with ALK wild-type (p&#160;=&#160;0.004), and the same results were found in OS analysis.The accumulation of EGFR driver gene mutation frequencies mediates the progression of LUAD from AIS to MIA. When the tumour progresses to stage IA invasive adenocarcinoma, multivariate analysis based on driver gene status can be used as a pivotal prognostic factor.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325962": {"ArticleTitle": "The association between low skeletal muscle mass and low skeletal muscle radiodensity with functional impairment, systemic inflammation and reduced survival in patients with incurable cancer: a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study.", "AbstractText": "Factors associated with the concomitant occurrence of low muscle mass and low muscle radiodensity are unclear. This study investigated whether different skeletal muscle phenotypes are associated with functional impairment, serum inflammatory markers, and survival in patients with incurable cancer.Three hundred and twenty-six patients (median age 60 years, 67.5% female) who had abdominal or pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans up to 30 days before the initial assessment were enrolled in the study.

Optimal stratification analysis was used to derive cohort-specific cutoff points to define SMI and SMD groups with higher risk for mortality (SMI, males <45.0 cm2 /m2 ; females <44.0 cm2 /m2 ; SMD, males <34 HU; females <30 HU). Based on these cutoffs, participants were classified into four phenotypes: low-risk SMI + low-risk SMD; high-risk SMI + low-risk SMD; low-risk SMI + high-risk SMD; and high-risk SMI + high-risk SMD.Phenotypes with high-risk SMI or high-risk SMD, especially when combined were associated with low handgrip strength (HGS), poor performance status, higher C-reactive protein and lower albumin. The phenotypes with high-risk SMD, regardless of low-risk SMI (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.05-2.88) or high-risk SMI (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.29-3.05) were associated with higher 90-days mortality risk.In patients with incurable cancer, phenotype groups with high-risk SMI and high-risk SMD, particularly when combined, were associated with worse functional impairment and inflammation.

After replacement of the original signal peptide sequence with the Ig Kappa leader sequence, codon-optimized NGFR100W mRNA yielded high secretion of mature NGFR100W , which promoted axon growth in PC12 cells. Using lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-delivery of N1-methylpseudouridine-modified mRNA in mice, NGFR100W -mRNA-LNPs resulted in the successful expression of NGFR100W protein, which significantly reduced nociceptive activity compared to that of NGFWT . This indicated that NGFR100W derived from exogenous mRNA elicited \"painless\" neuroprotective activity. Additionally, the therapeutic value of NGFR100W mRNA was established in a paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy model by demonstrating the rapid recovery of intraepidermal nerve fibers.

Hyperglycemia can result in increased glycation, the process wherein crosslinkages are formed between sugars and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins through the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Although accumulation of AGEs occurs naturally in vivo over time, it is greatly accelerated by the hyperglycemic environment of diabetic patients. AGE accumulation has been linked to stiffening-related diseases such as hypertension, cancer metastasis, and neurodegenerative disorders. In response, several AGE-inhibiting and AGE-breaking drugs have received significant attention for their ability to reduce AGE accumulation. The resulting effects of these drugs on cell behavior is not well understood. In this study, we measured cancer cell migration in glycated collagen with and without the AGE-breaking drug alagebrium chloride (ALT711) to investigate the drug's ability to disrupt ECM crosslinks and reduce tumor cell spreading, contractility, and migration. The mechanical properties and chemical composition of collagen glycated with increasing concentrations of glucose with and without ALT711 treatment were measured. Increasing glucose concentration resulted in increased AGE accumulation and matrix stiffness as well as increased cancer cell contractility, elongation, and migration. Treatment with ALT711 significantly lowered AGE accumulation within the collagen, decreased collagen stiffness, and reduced cell migration. These findings suggest that while hyperglycemia can increase collagen matrix stiffness, resulting in increased breast cancer cell migration, an AGE-breaker can reverse this phenotype and may be a viable treatment option for reducing cancer cell migration due to glycation.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325926": {"ArticleTitle": "NIR-II-triggered doxorubicin release for orthotopic bladder cancer chemo-photothermal therapy.", "AbstractText": "Intravesical instillation has been widely utilized for bladder cancer treatment in clinic.

Therefore, designing an efficient and controllable drug delivery nanoplatform is of great significance for bladder cancer treatment. Non-invasive therapy based on near-infrared-II (NIR-II) photothermal therapy (PTT) conduces to overcome bladder mucosal barrier and enhance drug delivery. Also, the photothermal nanomaterials, Au Hollow Nanorods (AuHNRs), demonstrate strong photothermal properties and drug loading capacity.

The drug loading capacity of DNAH reached 117.20%. Also, the thermal decomposition of NH4HCO3 realized NIR-II-triggered gas-driven drug burst release, and the doxorubicin release was 2.79 times higher within 1 h after NIR-II irradiation.

They mediate the clearance of circulating plasma molecules controlling distant organ homeostasis. Studies suggest that Stab1 and Stab2 may affect atherosclerosis. Although subsets of tissue macrophages also express Stab1, hematopoietic Stab1 deficiency does not modulate atherogenesis. Here, we comprehensively studied how targeting Stab1 and Stab2 affects atherosclerosis.ApoE-KO mice were interbred with Stab1-KO and Stab2-KO mice and fed a Western diet. For antibody targeting, Ldlr-KO mice were also used. Unbiased plasma proteomics were performed and independently confirmed. Ligand binding studies comprised glutathione-S-transferase-pulldown and endocytosis assays. Plasma proteome effects on monocytes were studied by single-cell RNA sequencing in vivo, and by gene expression analyses of Stabilin ligand-stimulated and plasma-stimulated bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages in vitro.Spontaneous and Western diet-associated atherogenesis was significantly reduced in ApoE-Stab1-KO and ApoE-Stab2-KO mice. Similarly, inhibition of Stab1 or Stab2 by monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced Western diet-associated atherosclerosis in ApoE-KO and Ldlr-KO mice. Although neither plasma lipid levels nor circulating immune cell numbers were decisively altered, plasma proteomics revealed a switch in the plasma proteome, consisting of 231 dysregulated proteins comparing wildtype with Stab1/2-single and Stab1/2-double KO, and of 41 proteins comparing ApoE-, ApoE-Stab1-, and ApoE-Stab2-KO. Among this broad spectrum of common, but also disparate scavenger receptor ligand candidates, periostin, reelin, and TGFBi (transforming growth factor, &#946;-induced), known to modulate atherosclerosis, were independently confirmed as novel circulating ligands of Stab1/2. Single-cell RNA sequencing of circulating myeloid cells of ApoE-, ApoE-Stab1-, and ApoE-Stab2-KO mice showed transcriptomic alterations in patrolling (Ccr2-/Cx3cr1++/Ly6Clo) and inflammatory (Ccr2+/Cx3cr1+/Ly6Chi) monocytes, including downregulation of proatherogenic transcription factor Egr1. In wildtype bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages, ligand exposure alone did not alter Egr1 expression in vitro. However, exposure to plasma from ApoE-Stab1-KO and ApoE-Stab2-KO mice showed a reverted proatherogenic macrophage activation compared with ApoE-KO plasma, including downregulation of Egr1 in vitro.Inhibition of Stab1/Stab2 mediates an anti-inflammatory switch in the plasma proteome, including direct Stabilin ligands. The altered plasma proteome suppresses both patrolling and inflammatory monocytes and, thus, systemically protects against atherogenesis.

These features have hampered disease modeling and mechanistic understanding. Here, we show that 2 structural cardiac diseases, left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and bicuspid aortic valve, can be caused by a set of inherited heterozygous gene mutations affecting the NOTCH ligand regulator MIB1 (MINDBOMB1) and cosegregating genes.We used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate mice harboring a nonsense or a missense MIB1 mutation that are both found in LVNC families. We also generated mice separately carrying these MIB1 mutations plus 5 additional cosegregating variants in the ASXL3, APCDD1, TMX3, CEP192, and BCL7A genes identified in these LVNC families by whole exome sequencing. Histological, developmental, and functional analyses of these mouse models were carried out by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, together with gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing of both selected engineered mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Potential biochemical interactions were assayed in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot.Mice homozygous for the MIB1 nonsense mutation did not survive, and the mutation caused LVNC only in heteroallelic combination with a conditional allele inactivated in the myocardium. The heterozygous MIB1 missense allele leads to bicuspid aortic valve in a NOTCH-sensitized genetic background. These data suggest that development of LVNC is influenced by genetic modifiers present in affected families, whereas valve defects are highly sensitive to NOTCH haploinsufficiency. Whole exome sequencing of LVNC families revealed single-nucleotide gene variants of ASXL3, APCDD1, TMX3, CEP192, and BCL7A cosegregating with the MIB1 mutations and LVNC. In experiments with mice harboring the orthologous variants on the corresponding Mib1 backgrounds, triple heterozygous Mib1 Apcdd1 Asxl3 mice showed LVNC, whereas quadruple heterozygous Mib1 Cep192 Tmx3;Bcl7a mice developed bicuspid aortic valve and other valve-associated defects. Biochemical analysis suggested interactions between CEP192, BCL7A, and NOTCH. Gene expression profiling of mutant mouse hearts and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes revealed increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and defective morphological and metabolic maturation.These findings reveal a shared genetic substrate underlying LVNC and bicuspid aortic valve in which MIB1-NOTCH variants plays a crucial role in heterozygous combination with cosegregating genetic modifiers.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325902": {"ArticleTitle": "Endogenous SOD2 (Superoxide Dismutase) Regulates Platelet-Dependent Thrombin Generation and Thrombosis During Aging.", "AbstractText": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to platelet hyperactivation during aging.

In its intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway opposing members of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family meet at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) to control its integrity. Any imbalance can cause disorders, with upregulation of the cell-guarding anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein itself being common in many, often incurable cancers. Normally, the Bcl-2 protein itself is embedded in the MOM where it sequesters cell-killing apoptotic proteins such as Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) which would otherwise perforate the MOM and subsequently cause cell death. However, the molecular basis of Bcl-2's ability to recognize those apoptotic proteins via their common BH3 death motifs remains elusive due to the lack of structural insight. By employing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on fully functional human Bcl-2 protein in membrane-mimicking micelles, we identified glycine residues across all functional domains of the Bcl-2 protein, and could monitor their residue specific individual response upon the presence of a Bax-derived 36 aa long BH3 domain. The observed chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) allowed us to determine the response and individual affinity of each glycine residue and provide an overall picture of the individual roles by which Bcl-2's functional domains engage in recognizing and inhibiting apoptotic proteins via their prominent BH3 motifs. This way, we provide a unique residue and domain specific insight into the molecular functioning of Bcl-2 at the membrane level; an insight also opening up for interfering with this cell-protecting mechanism in cancer therapy.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325601": {"ArticleTitle": "Surgical wounding enhances pro-tumor macrophage responses and accelerates tumor growth and lung metastasis in a triple negative breast cancer mouse model.", "AbstractText": "Approximately one-third of all breast cancer mortality results from metastatic recurrence after initial success of surgery and/or therapy.

As expected then, wounded mice displayed decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in both the primary tumor and in the lungs. Flow cytometry revealed that primary tumors from wounded mice exhibited increased tumor associated macrophages and specifically M2-like macrophages, which are important in promoting tumor development, maintenance, and metastasis.

SB28 and sham mice were imaged at an early (week-1; n = 6 SB28, n = 6 sham) and a late time-point (week-3; n = 8 SB28, n = 9 sham) after inoculation. Standard of truth ex vivo tumor volumes were obtained for SB28 mice at the late time-point. Tracer kinetics were analyzed for the lesion site and the carotid arteries to establish an image derived input function (IDIF). TSPO-PET and ceCT lesion volumes were compared with ex vivo volumes by calculation of root-mean-square-errors (RMSE). Volumes of distribution (VTmax/mean) in the lesion were calculated using carotid IDIF and standardized uptake values (SUVmax/mean) were obtained for a 40-60 min time frame.Higher uptake rate constants (K1) were observed for week-1 SB28 tumor lesions when compared to week-3 SB28 tumor lesions. Highest agreement between TSPO-PET lesion volumes and ex vivo tumor volumes was achieved with a 50% maximum threshold (RMSE-VT: 39.7%; RMSE-SUV: 34.4%), similar to the agreement of ceCT tumor volumes (RMSE: 30.1%). Lesions of SB28 mice had higher PET signal when compared to sham mice at week-1 (VTmax 6.6 &#177; 2.9 vs. 3.9 &#177; 0.8, p = 0.035; SUVmax 2.3 &#177; 0.5 vs. 1.2 &#177; 0.1, p < 0.001) and PET signals remained at a similar level at week-3 (VTmax 5.0 &#177; 1.6 vs. 2.7 &#177; 0.8, p = 0.029; SUVmax 1.9 &#177; 0.5 vs. 1.2 &#177; 0.2, p = 0.0012). VTmax correlated with SUVmax (R 2 = 0.532, p < 0.001).TSPO-PET imaging of immunocompetent SB28 mice facilitates early detection of tumor signals over sham lesions. SB28 tumors mirror high TSPO-PET signals of human glioblastoma and could serve as a valuable translational model to study TSPO as an imaging biomarker.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325384": {"ArticleTitle": "RNA-based drugs and regulation: Toward a necessary evolution of the definitions issued from the European union legislation.", "AbstractText": "Many RNA-based drugs, both vaccines and non-vaccines, are under development or even approved.

In this article, we first analyzed 38 published solid tumor CART trials and correlated the response rate to their ABD affinity. Not surprisingly, majority (25 trials) of the CARTs utilized high-affinity ABDs, but generated merely 5.7% response rate. In contrast, 35% of the patients treated with the CARTs built from moderate-affinity ABDs had clinical responses. Thus, CARTs with moderate-affinity ABDs not only have less off-target toxicity, but also are more effective. We then reviewed the effects of ABD affinity on the biology and function of CARTs, providing further evidence that moderate-affinity ABDs may be better in CART development.

Consequently, macrophages exhibit significant plasticity and change their transcriptional profile and function in response to environmental, tissue, and inflammatory stimuli resulting in pro- and anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, the categorization of tissue macrophages in inflammatory situations remains difficult; however, there is an agreement that macrophages are predominantly polarized into two different subtypes with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, the so-called M1-like and M2-like macrophages, respectively. These two macrophage classes can be considered as the extreme borders of a continuum of many intermediate subsets. On one end, M1 are pro-inflammatory macrophages that initiate an immunological response, damage tissue integrity, and dampen tumor progression by fostering robust T and natural killer (NK) cell anti-tumoral responses. On the other end, M2 are anti-inflammatory macrophages involved in tissue remodeling and tumor growth, that promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and that participate to immune suppression. These decisive roles in tumor progression occur through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases, as well as by the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in the case of M2 macrophages. Moreover, macrophage plasticity is supported by stimuli from the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) that are relayed to the nucleus through membrane receptors and signaling pathways that result in gene expression reprogramming in macrophages, thus giving rise to different macrophage polarization outcomes.

A pre-trained ResNet-18 extracts the US features typically identified as morphologies of suspicious ovarian lesions, and a Unet is implemented to reconstruct optical absorption coefficient maps, using the initial pressure and US features extracted by ResNet-18. To test this US-Unet model, we calculated the blood oxygenation saturation values and total hemoglobin concentrations from 655 regions of interest (ROIs) (421 benign, 200 malignant, and 34 borderline ROIs) obtained from clinical images of 35 patients with ovarian/adnexal lesions. A logistic regression model was used to compute the ROC, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.94, and the accuracy was 0.89. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reconstruct quantitative PAT with PA signals and US-based structural features.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325297": {"ArticleTitle": "Dendritic cells transfected with a polyepitope DNA construct stimulate an antitumor cytotoxic response in various tumors.", "AbstractText": "Dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are known to be crucial for the antitumor response and are still included in various treatment regimens in cancer immunotherapy research.

Thin-film hydration technique was used for the preparation and entrapment of curcumin and miRNA in niosomal formulations for enhancing the stability and delivery rate of the agents. Herein, the influence of Tween-80, Tween-60, cholesterol, and DOTAP on the entrapment efficiency (EE%) of curcumin and the physicochemical properties of the carrier are fully discussed. The optimum engineered formulation resulted in a positive charge of +11.23&#160;mV, high EE (100%), smooth surface, spherical shape, small diameter (90&#160;nm), and good stability in physiological buffers. Also, an accelerated cellular uptake, as well as drug release in PBS (pH 7.4, 37&#176;C) after 72&#160;h, were observed. The cytotoxic activity of curcumin (Cur)/miR-34a-loaded nanoparticles was determined by the MTT assay. The results displayed an improved cytotoxic activity of Cur-niosome towards cancer cells compared to free-dispersed Cur. The uptake of Cur-loaded niosome by A280s and A280cp-1 cancer cell lines faced 2.5 folds drop in the concentration compared to its free form. Generally, Cur-niosome exhibits a significant accumulation of superior anti-cancer properties. Likewise, the cytotoxicity of miR-34a-niosome against tumor cells was higher in comparison with its free form. The anti-cancer effects of the gene/drug delivery were investigated in the 4T1 xenografted Balb/C mouse tumor model. According to the in vitro and in vivo results, gene delivery from the modified niosome nanoparticles was distinctly greater than Cur delivery. Therefore, it was concluded that encapsulation of genes in the nano-niosomal delivery system is a promising procedure for the treatment of cancer cells.", "query": "cancer"}, "36325271": {"ArticleTitle": "Immune Biomarkers in the Peripheral Blood and Tumor Microenvironment of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients in Relation to Tumor Burden and Response to Treatment.", "AbstractText": "In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), the malignant cells represent only a small fraction of the tumor.

Here, we aimed at characterizing circulating lymphocytes and plasma proteins in relation to clinical parameters and treatment effect. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were obtained from 48 consecutive patients at diagnosis and at 2 time points after successful primary treatment. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from lymph node (LN) biopsies obtained for routine diagnostic purposes. Twenty healthy individuals were included as controls. Cells from PB and LN were analyzed by flow cytometry, and plasma proteins by Proximity Extension Assay. We found that the frequencies of T and B cells positively correlated between the LN and the PB compartments. Compared to controls, cHL patients had higher frequencies of proliferating T cells as well as higher expression of programmed death (PD)-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 in circulating T cells, and lower naive T-cell frequencies. Advanced-stage patients had fewer NK cells with a functionally impaired phenotype. Differences in the immune profile were observed in patients with a high tumor burden and with high inflammation, respectively. Most of these deviations disappeared after standard first-line treatment. Patients who received radiotherapy involving the mediastinum had low T-cell counts for a prolonged period.

Patients who are diagnosed with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) have a high rate of micro-metastatic disease and have a much poorer prognosis compared with patients who have less advanced lesions. Historically, neoadjuvant administration of cisplatin-based therapy followed by surgery has been the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately, of patients who come in with initially diagnosed MIBC, more than 50% are ineligible for traditional cisplatin-based therapy. Today, new modalities of treatment such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are beginning to radically improve outcomes in this population. The addition of immune checkpoint therapy to traditional chemotherapy appears to augment pathologic complete response rates in the bladder during surgery. Immunotherapy combinations also provide novel trimodality approaches with excellent outcomes in those pursuing non-surgical management. Pure immunotherapy approaches appear promising in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab is now approved in the adjuvant setting for high-risk patients. Antibody drug conjugates, such as enfortumab vedotin, and targeted therapies, such as infigratinib, are in trials in the perioperative setting.

During this process, cells de-differentiate by mechanically pinching off their epithelial determinants, but how they trans-differentiate into a migratory, mesenchymal phenotype is not known. Here, we demonstrate that basally extruded KRasV12-expressing cells become significantly deformed as they invade the zebrafish body. Decreasing the confinement that cells experience after they invade reduces the percentage of KRasV12 cells that trans-differentiate into mesenchymal cell types, while higher confinement increases this percentage. Additionally, increased confinement promotes accumulation of internal masses over time.

Six optimal predictors were selected, including IL-2, IL-7, HGF, IFN-&#947;, CA19-9 and CEA. The risk model based on these predictors was built and named circulating tumor-associated inflammatory index (CTII). The CTII (AUCs > 0.90) showed superior performance to systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, AUCs < 0.65) in OS.A circulating cytokine-based risk model for patients with PCLM before first ablation has been proposed and validated, which has demonstrated superior performance in predicting survival and has the potential to inform clinical treatment strategies.", "query": "cancer"}, "36324858": {"ArticleTitle": "Screen-based digital learning methods in radiation oncology and medical education.", "AbstractText": "The field of radiation oncology is rapidly advancing through technological and biomedical innovation backed by robust research evidence. In addition, cancer professionals are notoriously time-poor, meaning there is a need for high quality, accessible and tailored oncological education programs. Digital learning (DL) is well-placed to cater to these needs, as it provides teaching options that can be delivered flexibly and on-demand from anywhere in the world. The evidence for usage of these techniques in medical education has expanded rapidly in recent years. However, there remains many reservations in the oncological community to adopting and developing DL, largely due to a poor familiarity with the pedagogical evidence base. This article will review the application of the screen-based DL tools that are at educators' disposal. It will summarize best-practice in developing tailored, made-for-screen videos, gamification, and infographics. It also reviews data behind the following practical tips of 1) strategically combining text with graphics to decrease cognitive load, 2) engaging users through use of interactive elements in digital content, and 3) maximizing impact through thoughtful organization of animations/images. Overall, the digital space evolving is well placed to cater to the evolving educational needs of oncology learners.

Furthermore, we explore the correlation between strategies and EEG markers to moderate emotions and trust.This research selects different scenarios and strategies in the context of breast cancer and performs two experiments. First, we performed a behavioral experiment with 93 medical students and 15 breast cancer patients. Moreover, an EEG experiment with 53 students via video stimuli was conducted to explore the moderate function between strategies and emotions/trust. We use time-frequency analysis and the repeated measure ANOVA method to explore the association between strategy and EEG components. Furthermore, we perform a GLM method to investigate the relationship between EEG components and patient emotion and trust.For the first time, this study proposes the strategy matrix. The response strategies NPIm and NRIa play important roles in this system. In behavioral experiments, information delivery, empathy, and authority strategy significantly affect emotions and trust. The scenario is significant as a moderator. In the EEG experiment, strategy NPIm has more correlation with parietal alpha power than other strategies, and parietal alpha power has a significant effect on emotions, which verifies that empathy-related cerebral activities affect emotions and trust.According to the strategy matrix, physicians could apply strategy ERIa in most scenarios, and strategy NRIa in many scenarios, which means information provision is significant when it comes to responding to patients' cues and concerns. The most important strategy that physicians need to avoid is the authority strategy. Refusing to respond to patients' cues and concerns may cause their dislike.

Therefore, targeting tumor-associated macrophages is a possible strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Purpose: We would like to investigate the role of sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) and the effect of the synthase 2 selective inhibitor YE2 in TAMs and the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. In addition, we also would like to investigate the mechanism by which YE2 attenuates macrophage M2 polarization. Methods: YE2 was utilized to treat macrophages (in vitro) and mice (in vivo). Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect the protein levels and mRNA levels of macrophage M2 polarization markers and their downstream signaling pathways. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 gene knockout (KO) mice and their controls were used to establish a PANC-02 orthotopic pancreatic cancer model, and immune cell infiltration in the tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: We found that sphingomyelin synthase 2 mRNA expression is positively correlated with tumor-associated macrophages, the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Sphingomyelin synthase 2 deficiency was confirmed to have an inhibitory effect on the growth of orthotopic PANC-02 tumors in vivo. The deficiency not only reduced the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages but also regulated other immune components in the tumor microenvironment. In tissue culture, YE2 inhibited M2 polarization in both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and THP-1 macrophages and eliminated the protumor effect of M2 macrophages. In the mouse model, YE2 treatment reduced the infiltration of TAMs and regulated other immune components in the tumor microenvironment, slowing the progression of PANC-02 tumors. In terms of mechanism, we found that the inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase 2 could downregulate the expression of IL4R&#945; and CSF1R, thereby attenuating M2 polarization.

Molecular mechanisms underlying its complex pathogenesis are not fully understood. However, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), a DNA repair protein may play a central role, as OGG1 deficiency decreases both innate and allergic inflammation. Methods: Using a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic airway inflammation we assessed the utility of an inhibitor of OGG1 (TH5487) in this disease context. Cytokines and chemokines, promoting immune cell recruitment were measured using a 23-multiplex assay and Western blotting. Additionally, immune cell recruitment to bronchi was measured using flow cytometry. Histological analyses and immunofluorescent staining were used to confirm immune cell influx and goblet cell hyperplasia of the airways. A PCR array was used to assess asthma-related genes in murine lung tissue following TH5487 treatment. Finally, airway hyperresponsiveness was determined using in vivo lung function measurement. Results: In this study, administration of TH5487 to mice with OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation significantly decreased goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production. TH5487 treatment also decreased levels of activated NF-&#954;B and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in significantly lower recruitment of eosinophils and other immune cells to the lungs. Gene expression profiling of asthma and allergy-related proteins after TH5487 treatment revealed differences in several important regulators, including down regulation of Tnfrsf4, Arg1, Ccl12 and Ccl11, and upregulation of the negative regulator of type 2 inflammation, Bcl6.

More efficient treatments are desperately needed. For decades, the success of platinum-based anticancer drugs has promoted the exploration of metal-based agents. Four ruthenium-based complexes have also entered clinical trials as candidates of anticancer metallodrugs. However, systemic toxicity, severe side effects and drug-resistance impeded their applications and efficacy. Stimuli-responsiveness of Pt- and Ru-based complexes provide a great chance to weaken the side effects and strengthen the clinical efficacy in drug design. This review provides an overview on the stimuli-responsive Pt- and Ru-based metallic anticancer drugs for lung cancer.

The toxicity was assessed by acute toxicity and micronucleus tests in mice. The in vivo antitumor effect of ACS-AZ (12.5, 25, or 50&#160;mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) was determined using the Ehrlich tumor model, and toxicity. The antinociceptive efficacy of the compound (50&#160;mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated using formalin and hot plate assays in mice. The role of the opioid system was also investigated. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 (lethal dose 50%) value was 500&#160;mg/kg (i.p.), and no detectable genotoxic effect was observed. After a 7-day treatment, ACS-AZ significantly (p < 0.05) reduced tumor cell viability and peritumoral microvessels density, suggesting antiangiogenic action. In addition, ACS-AZ reduced (p < 0.05) IL-1&#946; and CCL-2 levels, which may be related to the antiangiogenic effect, while increasing (p < 0.05) TNF-&#945; and IL-4 levels, which are related to its direct cytotoxicity. ACS-AZ also decreased (p < 0.05) oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) levels, both of which are crucial mediators in cancer known for their angiogenic action. Moreover, weak toxicological effects were recorded after a 7-day treatment (biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters). Concerning antinociceptive activity, ACS-AZ was effective on hotplate and formalin (early and late phases) tests (p < 0.05), characteristic of analgesic agents with central action. Through pretreatment with the non-selective (naloxone) and &#956;1-selective (naloxonazine) opioid antagonists, we observed that the antinociceptive effect of ACS-AZ is mediated mainly by &#956;1-opioid receptors (p < 0.05).

In detail, associations with cancer status were observed for hypercholesterinemia and thyroid diseases. Moreover, CCS were more likely to take regular medication compared to controls. A similar association was observed for CCS of SPN compared to CCS of FPN. In contrast to controls, CCS rarely exercise more than 5 hours per week, consumed fewer soft and alcoholic drinks, and were less likely to be current, former, or passive smokers. Additionally, they were less likely overweight or obese. All other exploratory analyses performed on cardiovascular, chronic lung, inflammatory bone, allergic, and infectious diseases, as well as on a calculated health-score revealed no association with tumor status.CCS were more affected by pathologic conditions and may consequently take more medication, particularly among CCS of SPN. The observed higher disease burden is likely related to the received cancer therapy.

Although the PARPi Olaparib is limited to treating cancer patients with DNA repair deficiencies, the PARPi Niraparib is FDA approved to treat ovarian cancer patients regardless of their status in DNA repair pathways. Despite differences in the affinity to PARP enzymes, the rationale behind the clinical use of Niraparib in patients without DNA repair deficiencies is still lacking. Moreover, only Olaparib has been approved for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with BRCA mutations, accounting for only 5-7% of total PDACs. It remains unclear whether Niraparib could be beneficial to PDACs without BRCA mutations. We found that Niraparib inhibits ovarian and PDAC tumor cell growth, regardless of BRCA mutational status, more effectively than Olaparib. Unlike Olaparib, which is known to activate STAT3, Niraparib inhibits STAT3 activity in ovarian and PDAC cancer cell lines and patient tumors. Moreover, Niraparib regulates the expression of several STAT3 downstream genes involved in apoptosis. Overexpression of a constitutively activated STAT3 mutant rescues Niraparib-induced cancer cell apoptosis. Our results suggest that Niraparib inhibits pSTAT3 by interfering with SRC tyrosine kinase.

Novel ferroptosis markers and targeted colon cancer therapies are urgently needed. To this end, we performed a preliminary exploration of ferroptosis-related genes in colon cancer to enable new treatment strategies.Ferroptosis-related genes in colon cancer were obtained by data mining and screening for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics analysis tools. We normalized the data across four independent datasets and a ferroptosis-specific database.

Hereby, we present a retrospective validation of the algorithm comparing surgeons' performance.The semantic segmentation algorithm to be validated was trained on non-contrast CT scans from a single center. A retrospective pilot study was performed. An independent validation dataset was constituted by an arbitrary selection from patients who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy in three institutions during Apr. 2020 to Jun. 2021. The golden standard of anatomical variants of each enrolled case was obtained via expert surgeons' judgments based on chest CT, 3-D reconstruction, and surgical observation. The performance of the algorithm is compared against the performance of two junior thoracic surgery attendings based on chest CT.A total of 27 cases were included in this study. The overall case-wise accuracy of the AI model was 82.8% in pulmonary vessels compared to 78.8% and 77.0% for the two surgeons, respectively. Segmental artery accuracy was 79.7%, 73.6%, and 72.7%; lobular vein accuracy was 96.3%, 96.3%, and 92.6% by the AI model and two surgeons, respectively. No statistical significance was found. In subgroup analysis, the anatomic structure-wise analysis of the AI algorithm showed a significant difference in accuracies between different lobes (p = 0.012). Higher AI accuracy in the right-upper lobe (RUL) and left-lower lobe (LLL) arteries was shown. A trend of better performance in non-contrast CT was also detected. Most recognition errors by the algorithm were the misclassification of LA1+2 and LA3. Radiological parameters did not exhibit a significant impact on the performance of both AI and surgeons.The semantic segmentation algorithm achieves the recognition of the segmental pulmonary artery and the lobular pulmonary vein.

First, an online survey on surveillance practice of stage-I TGCT based on clinical-cases was conducted among urologists, radiation-oncologists and medical-oncologists. These results were compared to ESMO/EAU and AFU guidelines. Then a panel of experts assessed surveillance proposals following a Delphi-CM.

In this study, we assumed an explanation that the roles of HMGs in ICS were stage specific. Bulk RNA-seq on endoscopy biopsy samples from a total of 50 patients was accompanied by reanalysis of a set of published single-cell transcriptomes, which cross-sectionally profiled the transcriptomic features of chronic superficial gastritis (SG), atrophy gastritis (AG), IM, and early gastric cancer (GC). Differential analysis observed significantly peaked expression of SIRT6 and SIRT7 at IM. Weighted correlation network analysis on bulk transcriptome recognized significant correlations between SIRT1/6 and IM. The single-cell atlas identified one subgroup of B cells expressing high level of TFF1 (TFF1 hi naive B cell) that theoretically played important roles in defending microbial infection, while SIRT6 displayed a positive correlation with TFF1 low naive B cells. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis at different lesions (SG-AG, AG-IM, and IM-GC) highlighted that gene sets contributing to IM, e.g., Brush Border, were largely enriched from co-expressing genes of Sirtuins (SIRTs) in AG-IM. Surveys of the genes negatively correlated with SIRT6 in public databases considered SIRT6 as tumor suppressors, which was confirmed by the cell proliferation and migration assays after transient transfection of SIRT6 overexpression vector into AGS cells. All the above observations were then confirmed by serial section-based immunohistochemistry against Ki-67, MUC2, MUC5AC, p53, and SIRT6 on the endoscopic submucosal dissection tissue. By contrast, the expression of the other HMGs varied even opposite within same family. Taken together, this study preliminarily demonstrated the two-edged sword role of SIRTs in ICS and, by extension, showed that the roles of HMGs in ICS were probably stage specific.

One of the most common reasons for therapy failure is the development of acquired resistance of cancer cells. DNA-damaging agents are frequently used in first-line chemotherapy regimens and DNA damage response, and DNA repair pathways are significantly involved in the mechanisms of chemoresistance. MRE11, a part of the MRN complex involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, is connected to colorectal cancer (CRC) patients' prognosis. Our previous results showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) microRNA (miRNA) binding sites of MRE11 gene are associated with decreased cancer risk but with shorter survival of CRC patients, which implies the role of miRNA regulation in CRC. The therapy of colorectal cancer utilizes oxaliplatin (oxalato(trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum), which is often compromised by chemoresistance development. There is, therefore, a crucial clinical need to understand the cellular processes associated with drug resistance and improve treatment responses by applying efficient combination therapies. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNAs on the oxaliplatin therapy response of CRC patients.

Ultrasonography showed that lesions were either hyperechoic (4/11, 36.36%), hypoechoic (4/11, 36.36%), isoechoic (1/11, 9.09%), or heterogeneously echoic (2/11, 18.18%). CDFI showed that most of the lesions had an abundant blood supply (9/11, 81.82%). Whether on CT scan or ultrasonography, the margins of the lesions were dominated by clear margins. Ultrasonography revealed more features: hyperechoic patterns around lesions (3/11, 27.27%) and lateral shadow (5/11, 45.45%). The CDFI showed that large blood vessels were observed around the lesions (9/11, 81.82%). CECT shows two enhancement patterns: \"fast in and fast out (FIFO)\" (8/11, 72.72%) and \"fast in and slow out (FISO)\" (3/11, 27.27%).

We aim to detect the prognostic value of CRs in LUAD and create favorable signature for assessing prognosis and clinical value of LUAD patients.The mRNA sequencing data and clinical information were obtained from TCGA and GEO databases. Gene consensus clustering analysis was utilized to determine the molecular subtype of LUAD. Cox regression methods were employed to set up the CRs-based signature (CRBS) for evaluating survival rate in LUAD. Biological function and signaling pathways were identified by KEGG and GSEA analyses. In addition, we calculated the infiltration level of immunocyte by CIBERSORT algorithm. The expressions of model hub genes were detected in LUAD cell lines by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).KEGG analysis suggested the CRs were mainly involved in histone modification, nuclear division and DNA modification. Consensus clustering analysis identified a novel CRs-associated subtype which divided the combined LUAD cohort into two clusters (C1 = 217 and C2 = 296). We noticed that a remarkable discrepancy in survival rate among two clusters. Then, a total of 120 differentially expressed CRs were enrolled into stepwise Cox analyses. Four hub CRs (CBX7, HMGA2, NPAS2 and PRC1) were selected to create a risk signature which could accurately forecast patient outcomes and differentiate patient risk. GSEA unearthed that mTORC1 pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p53 pathway were greatly enriched in CRBS-high cohort. Moreover, the infiltration percentages of macrophage M0, macrophage M2, resting NK cells, memory B cells, dendritic cells and mast cells were statistically significantly different in the two groups.

Our work aims at investigating the prognostic value of lipid metabolism-related lncRNAs in CC. Methods: LncRNA expression profiling was conducted in 291 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Patient samples were randomly assigned to the training or testing set in a 3:2 ratio. A novel lipid metabolism-related five-lncRNA signature with prognostic value for CC was built through the univariate Cox regression, least absolute contraction and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and was further evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier methods. Relevant analyses were also applied to identify the independent clinicopathological factors. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted to investigate the biological functions and molecular pathways. Immune infiltration analysis was included to probe the relationship between lncRNA signature and cancer cell microenvironment.

Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to assess the m6A modification patterns and identify m6A-modified genes in patients with CRC recurrence. Methods: The m6A modification patterns were comprehensively evaluated by the NMF algorithm based on the levels of 27 m6A regulators, and tumor microenvironment (TME) cell-infiltrating characteristics of these modification patterns were systematically assessed by ssGSEA and CIBERSORT algorithms. The principal component analysis algorithm based on the m6A scoring scheme was used to explore the m6A modification patterns of individual tumors with immune responses. The weighted correlation network analysis and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied to identify m6A-modified gene signatures. The single-cell expression dataset of CRC samples was used to explore the tumor microenvironment affected by these signatures. Results: Three distinct m6A modification patterns with significant recurrence-free survival (RFS) were identified in 804 CRC patients. The TME characterization revealed that the m6A modification pattern with longer RFS exhibited robust immune responses. CRC patients were divided into high- and low-score subgroups according to the m6A score individually, which was obtained from the m6A-related signature genes. The patients with low m6A scores had both longer RFS and overall survival (OS) with altered immune cell infiltration. Notably, m6A-modified genes showed significant differences related to the prognosis of CRC patients in the meta-GEO cohort and TCGA cohort. Single-cell expression indicated that ALVRL1 was centrally distributed in endothelial tip cells and stromal cells. Conclusion: The m6A modification plays an indispensable role in the formation of TME diversity and complexity.

Recent advances in imaging have enabled precise targeting of solid lesions. However, intratumoral heterogeneity makes treatment planning and monitoring more challenging. Conventional imaging cannot provide high-resolution observation and longitudinal monitoring of large-scale microvascular in response to radiotherapy directly in deep tissues. Herein, we report on an emerging non-invasive imaging assessment method of morphological and functional tumor microvasculature responses with high spatio-temporal resolution by means of optoacoustic imaging (OAI). In vivo imaging of 4T1 breast tumor response to a conventional fractionated radiotherapy at varying dose (14 &#215; 2&#160;Gy and 3 &#215; 8&#160;Gy) has been performed after 2&#160;weeks following treatment. Remarkably, optoacoustic images can generate richful contrast for the tumor microvascular architecture. Besides, the functional status of tumor microvasculature and tumor oxygenation levels were further estimated using OAI. The results revealed the differential (size-dependent) nature of vascular responses to radiation treatments at varying doses. The vessels exhibited an decrease in their density accompanied by a decline in the number of vascular segments following irradiation, compared to the control group. The measurements further revealed an increase of tumor oxygenation levels for 14 &#215; 2&#160;Gy and 3 &#215; 8&#160;Gy irradiations. Our results suggest that OAI could be used to assess the response to radiotherapy based on changes in the functional and morphological status of tumor microvasculature, which are closely linked to the intratumor microenvironment. OAI assessment of the tumor microenvironment such as oxygenation status has the potential to be applied to precise radiotherapy strategy.", "query": "cancer"}, "36324298": {"ArticleTitle": "Survival of Cancer Patients Treated with Non-Fermented Mistletoe Extract: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "AbstractText": "Mistletoe extracts (ME) are used in integrative cancer care to improve quality of life and to prolong survival.

Consistent with this theory, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert promising chemopreventive activity for ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, toxicity is associated with long-term use of NSAIDs due to their cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity. Previous studies suggest the antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs is COX independent, and rather may be exerted through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition. PDEs represent a unique chemopreventive target for ovarian cancer given that ovulation is regulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Here we evaluate PDE10A as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian tumors revealed PDE10A overexpression was associated with significantly worse overall survival for patients. PDE10A expression also positively correlated with the upregulation of oncogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Using small molecule inhibitors, Pf-2545920 and a novel NSAID-derived PDE10A inhibitor, MCI-030, we show that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased ovarian cancer cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate these pro-apoptotic properties occur through PKA and PKG signaling by using specific inhibitors to block their activity. PDE10A genetic knockout in ovarian cancer cells through CRISP/Cas9 editing lead to decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. We also demonstrate that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased Wnt-induced &#946;-catenin nuclear translocation, as well as decreased EGF-mediated activation of RAS/MAPK and AKT pathways in ovarian cancer cells.

Hence, it is essential for healthcare providers to effectively assess and communicate with patients' regarding their medical decisions before their patients are incapacitated by their disease progression. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the decisional balance, attitudes, and practice behaviors of ACP and its predictors of ACP-related experiences in Taiwanese patients with advanced cancer.This cross-sectional, descriptive study employed a mixed-methodsquantitative and qualitative design with a sample of 166 patients that were purposely recruited from in-patient oncology units at a regional teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. Study data consisted of patient replies to a 34-item self-report tool, Decisional Balance, Attitudes, Practice Behaviors of ACP (DAP-ACP) and 4 semi-structured questions.Findings indicated that, in general, study participants exhibited favorable ACP-decisional balance and positive ACP-attitudes & practice behaviors. The results also indicated that gender, educational level, and cancer diagnosis were associated with significant differences on the \"ACP-decisional balance\" and \"ACP-attitudes\" scales. In addition, our findings documented that the participants' gender and educational level were significant predictors of both ACP-decisional balance and ACP-attitudes. Furthermore the participants' ACP-practice behaviors were predicted by ACP-decisional balance, but not with their ACP-attitudes. The qualitative analysis of the semi-structured questions identified six themes in responses to current medical decision making (e.g., compliance with physician instructions, family engagement in treatment decision-making); and eight themes pertaining to future ACP-related concerns were identified (e.g., family conflict, effectiveness of time-limited trials).To promote patients' engagement in ACP, the healthcare professional need to assess and advocate patients' concerns or attitudes regarding ACP in a timely manner. In addition, factors or concerns that might influence patients' responses to ACP derived from both the quantitative and qualitative findings of this current study need to be considered especially in initiating the dialogue regarding ACP with patients with advanced cancer.No. CYCH 2,019,072, Date of registration 5 Dec 2019.", "query": "cancer"}, "36324095": {"ArticleTitle": "The outcomes and prognostic factors of patients who underwent reoperation for persistent/recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma.", "AbstractText": "While the most suitable approach for treating persistent/recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains controversial, reoperation may be considered an effective method.

PP2A is a highly conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of human cancers. However, the relationship between PP2A and the Warburg effect in gastric cancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, the expression profile of two endogenous inhibitors of PP2A, SET and CIP2A, in gastric cancer, were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies were performed to investigate the roles of PP2A in gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis. Cell biological, molecular, and biochemical approaches were employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that SET and CIP2A were overexpressed in gastric cancer and associated with a decreased PP2A activity. Pharmacological activation of PP2A with FTY-720 and DT-061 in two gastric cancer cell lines significantly reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation and glycolytic ability. Importantly, inhibition of PP2A activity by genetic silencing of PPP2R5A resulted in a growth advantage, which can be largely compromised by the addition of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, suggesting a glycolysis-dependent effect of PP2A in gastric cancer. Mechanistically, the well-known transcription factor and glycolysis regulator c-Myc was discovered as the functional mediator of PP2A in regulating cell glycolysis. Ectopic expression of a phosphorylation-mutant c-Myc resistant to PP2A (MycT58A) restored the inhibitory effect of FTY-720 and DT-061 on lactate production and glucose uptake. Furthermore, there was a close association between SET and CIP2A expression and c-Myc gene signatures in gastric cancer samples.

The PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a central role in cellular homeostasis and is often dysregulated in cancer. The increased expression of PI3K protein in the literature is associated with a poor prognosis, and alterations in the PIK3CA gene can lead to changes in downstream pathways. Thus, the objective of this study was to validate the protein expression to confirm the gene expression of proteins belonging to the main pathway PI3K and PTEN, and their downstream pathways through ZEB1, ZEB2, HIF1A, VHL, CASP3 and PARP1 relating to prognosis in canine mammary cancer. For protein studies, the samples came from 58 female dogs with mammary neoplasia, immunohistochemistry was performed and its analysis by the histoscore method. For the genetic evaluation, the samples came from 13 patients, the DNA was extracted and the analysis for quantitative expression. Through immunohistochemistry, PI3K positivity was significantly associated with affected regional lymph node, distant metastasis, patients with HER2+, Triple Negative and Luminal B phenotypes, and the lowest survival rates. Through gene expression, we observed higher gene expression of ZEB2 and PARP1 both among patients who were alive and who died, which was not true for the expressions of PIK3CA and HIF1A.

Here we demonstrate that elevated viscosity counterintuitively increases the motility of various cell types on two-dimensional surfaces and in confinement, and increases cell dissemination from three-dimensional tumour spheroids. Increased mechanical loading imposed by elevated viscosity induces an actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-complex-dependent dense actin network, which enhances Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) polarization through its actin-binding partner ezrin. NHE1 promotes cell swelling and increased membrane tension, which, in turn, activates transient receptor potential cation vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and mediates calcium influx, leading to increased RHOA-dependent cell contractility. The coordinated action of actin remodelling/dynamics, NHE1-mediated swelling and RHOA-based contractility facilitates enhanced motility at elevated viscosities. Breast cancer cells pre-exposed to elevated viscosity acquire TRPV4-dependent mechanical memory through transcriptional control of the Hippo pathway, leading to increased migration in zebrafish, extravasation in chick embryos and lung colonization in mice.

This retrospective and analytical study examined clinical, ultrasound and pathological data of 549 patients aged 45&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14&#160;years, including 468 females (85.2%), operated for thyroid nodule between January 2005 and January 2019. In the present study, only the highest graded nodule according to the EU-TIRADS score in each patient was taken into account for the statistical analyses. So 549 nodules were considered. Nodules classified EU-TIRADS 2 and 3 on the one hand, and, on the other hand, 4 and 5, were considered respectively at low and high risk of malignancy. The sensitivity and specificity of the EU-TIRADS score were calculated. The significance level was set at 5%. Of all patients, 21.7% had malignant nodules. They made 48.4% of the nodules in patients younger than and at 20&#160;years old, and 31.1% in those aged 60 or over. Malignant nodules were more frequent in men than in women (30.9% vs. 20.1%; p&#8201;=&#8201;0.024). Papillary carcinoma (67.2%) and follicular carcinoma (21.8%) were the main types. The malignancy rate was 39.7% and 1.5% among nodules rated EU-TIRADS 4 and 5, and those with EU-TIRADS score 2 and 3, respectively (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). The EU-TIRADS score had a sensitivity of 96.6% and a specificity of 59.3%. The ROC curve indicated an area under the curve of 0.862. In a low-income country, a well performed thyroid ultrasound, using the EU-TIRADS score, could be an important tool in the selection of thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy and requiring histopathological examination in the Congolese hospital setting.Trial registration: The research protocol had obtained the favorable opinion of the DRC national health ethics committee no. 197/CNES/BN/PMMF/2020.

To accomplish this goal, we devised a strategy to identify compounds that act synergistically with remdesivir in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conducted combinatorial high-throughput screening in the presence of submaximal remdesivir concentrations, using a human lung epithelial cell line infected with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. This identified 20 approved drugs that act synergistically with remdesivir, many with favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Strongest effects were observed with established antivirals, Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (HCV NS5A) inhibitors velpatasvir and elbasvir.

Changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in the patient groups stratified by prostate volume and the amount of testosterone reduction were assessed every 4&#160;weeks until 12&#160;weeks after androgen deprivation therapy initiation. Longitudinal mixed models were used to assess the adjusted effects of prostate volume and testosterone reduction on IPSS change. All mean values of IPSS-total score (IPSS-total), voiding subscore (IPSS-vs), and storage subscore (IPSS-ss) significantly decreased from baseline to week&#160;12 in both patients with small (<&#8201;33&#160;mL) and large (&#8805;&#8201;33&#160;mL) prostates. The mean values of IPSS-total, IPSS-vs, and IPSS-ss similarly decreased in patients with large prostate with a baseline IPSS-total of&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;13. However, in those with small prostate, IPSS-ss specifically remained unchanged, while IPSS-total and IPSS-vs significantly decreased. In addition, only in patients with small prostate (<&#8201;33&#160;mL), patients with lesser testosterone reduction (<&#8201;&#916;400&#160;ng/dL) showed greater improvement in IPSS-ss by 7.5% compared with those with greater testosterone reduction (&#8805;&#8201;&#916;400&#160;ng/dL).

To better understand potential mechanisms behind the observed variation in plumage colouration, we shifted our attention from a high-level expression of colour to low-level physiological phenomena by targeting the microstructure and pigment content of the feather. In a well-studied model system, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), we combined an experimental manipulation of birds' physiological condition and availability of resources that are key to the production of the studied colouration (phenylalanine and tyrosine (PT). We found that feathers from sparrows fed with the control diet had noticeably lower values of brightness, suggesting a higher quality of the ornamental \"blackness\" in comparison to those sampled from birds fed with a PT-reduced diet. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy detected higher melanin concentrations in samples from the control than the PT-reduced group. Our multi-level analysis excluded mechanisms such as barbule density and melanosomes' distribution, clearly pointing to the finest-level proxy of colour: the concentration of melanin in melanosomes themselves.

Effective immune reactivity against tumour antigens requires the infiltration and activation of tumour-infiltrating T-cells (TILs). In this context, ligation of the antigen-receptor complex (TCR) in combination with the co-receptor CD28 activates the intracellular mediator AKT (or PKB, protein kinase B) and its downstream targets. PD-1 inhibits the activation of AKT/PKB. Given this, we assessed whether the direct activation of AKT might be effective in activating the immune system to limit the growth of tumors that are resistant to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. We found that the small molecule activator of AKT (SC79) limited growth of a B16 tumor and an EMT-6 syngeneic breast tumor model that are poorly responsive to PD-1 immunotherapy. In the case of B16 tumors, direct AKT activation induced (i) a reduction of suppressor regulatory (Treg) TILs and (ii) an increase in effector CD8+ TILs. SC79 in vivo therapy caused a major increase in the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs to express&#160;interferon-&#947; (IFN-&#947;). This effect on IFN-&#947; expression distinguished responsive from non-responsive anti-tumor responses and could be recapitulated ex vivo with human T-cells. In CD4+FoxP3+Treg TILs, AKT induced IFN-&#947; expression was accompanied by a loss of suppressor activity, the conversation to CD4+ helper Th1-like TILs and a marked reduction in phospho-SHP2.

To define the biologic basis for and clinical significance of this morphologic heterogeneity, here we perform integrated genomic analyses of mixed histology bladder cancers with separable regions of urothelial and squamous differentiation. We find that squamous differentiation is a marker of intratumoral genomic and immunologic heterogeneity in patients with bladder cancer and a biomarker of intrinsic immunotherapy resistance. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that in all cases the urothelial and squamous regions are derived from a common shared precursor. Despite the presence of marked genomic heterogeneity between co-existent urothelial and squamous differentiated regions, no recurrent genomic alteration exclusive to the urothelial or squamous morphologies is identified. Rather, lineage plasticity in bladder cancers with squamous differentiation is associated with loss of expression of FOXA1, GATA3, and PPARG, transcription factors critical for maintenance of urothelial cell identity. Of clinical significance, lineage plasticity and PD-L1 expression is coordinately dysregulated via FOXA1, with patients exhibiting morphologic heterogeneity pre-treatment significantly less likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors.", "query": "cancer"}, "36323677": {"ArticleTitle": "Deep learning empowered volume delineation of whole-body organs-at-risk for accelerated radiotherapy.", "AbstractText": "In radiotherapy for cancer patients, an indispensable process is to delineate organs-at-risk (OARs) and tumors.

Moreover, MYC overexpression prevents the recruitment and activation of lymphocytes in both human and mouse TNBC co-culture models.

HMCD analogues with strongly ionisable sulphonic acid groups were not taken up by patient derived GBM cells, but were taken up by the U87MG cell line.

Especially appealing in this context is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is a photon-initiated treatment modality that uses cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill malignant cells. In the past decade, PDT has risen to the forefront of cancer therapy. Its optical control enables noninvasive and spatiotemporal manipulation of the treatment process, and its photoactive nature allows unique patterns to avoid drug resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. However, despite the impressive advances in this field, achieving widespread clinical adoption of PDT remains difficult. A major concern is that in the hostile tumor microenvironment, tumor cells are hypoxic, which hinders ROS generation during PDT action. To overcome this \"Achilles' heel\", current strategies focus primarily on the improvement of the intratumoral O2 perfusion, while clinical trials suggest that O2 enrichment may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, thereby making FDA approval and clinical transformation of these paradigms challenging.In an effort to improve hypoxia photodynamic therapy (hPDT) in the clinic, we have explored \"low to no O2-dependent\" photochemical approaches over the years to combat hypoxia-induced resistance. In this Account, we present our contributions to this theme during the past 5 years, beginning with low O2-dependent approaches (e.g., type I superoxide radical (O2&#8226;-) generator, photodynamic O2-economizer, mitochondrial respiration inhibition, cellular self-protective pathway modulation, etc.) and progressing to O2-independent strategies (e.g., autoadaptive PDT/PTT complementary therapy, O2-independent artificial photoredox catalysis in cells). These studies have attracted tremendous attention. Particularly in the pioneering work of 2018, we presented the first demonstration that the O2&#8226;--mediated partial O2-recyclability mechanism can overcome PDT resistance ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2018, 140, 14851-14859). This launched an era of renewed interest in type I PDT, resulting in a plethora of new O2&#8226;- photogenerators developed by many groups around the world. Moreover, with the discovery of O2-independent photoredox reactions in living cells, artificial photoredox catalysis has emerged as a new field connecting photochemistry and biomedicine, stimulating the development of next-generation phototherapeutic tools ( J.

Human APRIL-CAR T cells were evaluated for their cytotoxic function in vitro and in vivo, for their polyfunctionality, immune synapse formation, memory, exhaustion phenotype and tonic signaling activity. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we analyzed BCMA levels and cellular localization and quantified CAR T cell-target cell interactions by live microscopy. Impact on pathway activation and tumor cell proliferation was assessed in vitro and in vivo.APRIL-CAR T cells in a trimeric ligand binding conformation conferred fast but not sustained antitumor responses in vivo in mouse xenograft models. In vitro trimer-BB&#950; CAR T cells were more polyfunctional and formed stronger immune synapses than monomer-BB&#950; CAR T cells. After CAR T cell-myeloma cell contact, BCMA was rapidly downmodulated on target cells with all evaluated binding moieties.

CD40-targeting therapies designed to enhance antigen presentation, generate new tumor-specific T cells, and activate tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells to remodel the tumor microenvironment, represent a promising opportunity to meet this need. In this study, we present the first in vivo data supporting a role for tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-mediated uptake and cross-presentation of tumor antigens to enhance tumor-specific T-cell priming using CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies, a concept we named Neo-X-Prime.Bispecific antibodies targeting CD40 and either of two cell-surface expressed TAA, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEA) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), were developed in a tetravalent format. TAA-conditional CD40 agonism, activation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, antitumor efficacy and the role of delivery of tumor-derived material such as extracellular vesicles, tumor debris and exosomes by the CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies were demonstrated in vitro using primary human and murine cells and in vivo using human CD40 transgenic mice with different tumor models.The results showed that the CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies induced TAA-conditional CD40 activation both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it was demonstrated in vitro that they induced clustering of tumor debris and CD40-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner and superior T-cell priming when added to dendritic cells (DC), ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cells and OVA-containing tumor debris or exosomes. The antitumor activity of the Neo-X-Prime bispecific antibodies was demonstrated to be significantly superior to the monospecific CD40 antibody, and the resulting T-cell dependent antitumor immunity was directed to tumor antigens other than the TAA used for targeting (EpCAM).The data presented herein support the hypothesis that CD40&#215;TAA bispecific antibodies can engage tumor-derived vesicles containing tumor neoantigens to myeloid cells such as DCs resulting in an improved DC-mediated cross-priming of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.

Consequently, many patients are exposed to unnecessary adverse effects of imiquimod. On the other hand, conventional surgical large loop excision therapy is associated with increased risk of premature births in subsequent pregnancies. An in-depth analysis of the cHSIL immune microenvironment was performed in order to identify and develop a predictive biomarker for response to imiquimod, to maximize therapy efficacy and to avoid adverse effects in patients unlikely to respond.Biopsies of 35 cHSIL patients, before and 10 weeks on imiquimod treatment, were analyzed by two multispectral seven-color immunofluorescence panels for T cell and myeloid cell composition in relation to treatment response. Based on these results a simplified immunohistochemical detection protocol was developed. Samples were scanned with the Vectra multispectral imaging system and cells were automatically identified using machine learning.The immune microenvironment of complete responders (CR) is characterized by a strong and coordinated infiltration by T helper cells (activated PD1+/type 1 Tbet+), M1-like macrophages (CD68+CD163-) and dendritic cells (CD11c+) prior to imiquimod. The lesions of non-responders (NRs) displayed a high infiltration by CD3+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. At 10 weeks on imiquimod, a strong influx of intraepithelial and stromal CD4+ T cells was observed in CR but not NR patients. A steep decrease in macrophages occurred both in CR and NR patients, leveling the pre-existing differences in myeloid cell composition between the two groups. Based on the pre-existing immune composition differences, the sum of intraepithelial CD4 T cell, macrophage and dendritic cell counts was used to develop a quantitative simplified one color immunohistochemical biomarker, the CHSIL immune biomarker for imiquimod (CIBI), which can be automatically and unbiasedly quantified and has an excellent predictive capacity (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve 0.95, p<0.0001).The capacity of cHSIL patients to respond to imiquimod is associated with a pre-existing coordinated local immune process, fostering an imiquimod-mediated increase in local T cell infiltration.

TCA remains at the conceptual stage with existing studies unable to provide recommendations on the optimum injection rate, and reagent concentration and volume. Limitations in current experimental methodology have prevented proper elucidation of the thermochemical processes inside the tissue during TCA. Nevertheless, the computational TCA framework developed recently by Mak et&#160;al. [Mak et&#160;al., Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2022, 145:105494] has opened new avenues in the development of TCA. Specifically, a recommended safe dosage is imperative in driving TCA research beyond the conceptual stage.The aforesaid computational TCA framework for sequential injection was applied and adapted to simulate TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base at equimolar and equivolume. The developed framework, which describes the flow of acid and base, their neutralisation, the rise in tissue temperature and the formation of thermal damage, was solved numerically using the finite element method. The framework will be used to investigate the effects of injection rate, reagent concentration, volume and type (weak/strong acid-base combination) on temperature rise and thermal coagulation formation.A higher injection rate resulted in higher temperature rise and larger thermal coagulation. Reagent concentration of 7500&#160;mol/m3 was found to be optimum in producing considerable thermal coagulation without the risk of tissue overheating. Thermal coagulation volume was found to be consistently larger than the total volume of acid and base injected into the tissue, which is beneficial as it reduces the risk of chemical burn injury. Three multivariate second-order polynomials that express the targeted coagulation volume as functions of injection rate and reagent volume, for the weak-weak, weak-strong and strong-strong acid-base combinations were also derived based on the simulated data.A guideline for a safe and effective implementation of TCA with simultaneous injection of acid and base was recommended based on the numerical results of the computational model developed. The guideline correlates the coagulation volume with the reagent volume and injection rate, and may be used by clinicians in determining the safe dosage of reagents and optimum injection rate to achieve a desired thermal coagulation volume during TCA.", "query": "cancer"}, "36323171": {"ArticleTitle": "Trends in age and sex-specific prevalence of cancer and cancer subtypes in acute ischemic stroke from 2007-2019.", "AbstractText": "To describe age and sex-specific prevalence of cancer in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) hospitalizations in the United States over the last decade.We conducted a retrospective serial cross-sectional study using all primary AIS discharges (weighted n=5,748,358) with and without cancer in the 2007-2019 National Inpatient Sample.

CRC cells are geared toward rapid proliferation, requiring nutrients and the removal of cellular waste in nutrient-poor environments. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the primary cell of origin for CRCs, must adapt their metabolism along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to the unique features of their complex microenvironment that include interactions with intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, stromal cells, commensal microbes, and dietary components. Emerging evidence implicates modifiable risk factors related to the environment, such as diet, as important in CRC pathogenesis. Here, we focus on describing the metabolism of ISCs, diets that influence CRC initiation, CRC genetics and metabolism, and the tumor microenvironment. The mechanistic links between environmental factors, metabolic adaptations, and the tumor microenvironment in enhancing or supporting CRC tumorigenesis are becoming better understood. Thus, greater knowledge of CRC metabolism holds promise for improved prevention and treatment.

However, the data remain limited, particularly in Western populations, and are often contradictory. In this study, the prognostic value of positive SOX9 immunohistochemistry was compared with that of more established markers EpCAM and K19 in a large cohort (n=216) of North American patients. The independent HCC cohort in The Cancer Gene Atlas (n=360) was utilized to validate our findings. Finally, molecular signatures associated with SOX9-high HCC were determined. We found that the expression of SOX9, but not EpCAM or K19, was associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in our North American cohort, in which hepatitis C infection was the most common underlying etiology. High SOX9 mRNA level, but not increased expression of EpCAM mRNA or K19 mRNA, was also associated with worse DFS and was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in The Cancer Gene Atlas cohort. This group had underlying causes, including an increased incidence of hepatitis B, significantly different from our initial cohort. High SOX9 mRNA level is associated with molecular pathways important in HCC pathogenesis. Increased SOX9 expression is clinically and biologically relevant for HCC arising in patients with a variety of underlying etiologies.

A complement C1Q+ macrophage-like leukemia subset which is enriched within cutis and existed in BM prior to EMI manifestations was identified and further verified in multiple AML patients.

RNA-sequencing and quantitative proteomics analysis revealed expression dynamics of C1Q from primary to relapse. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated adverse prognosis significance of C1Q expression. Mechanistically, C1Q expression, which was modulated by transcription factor MAFB, endowed leukemia cells with tissue-infiltration ability which could establish prominent cutaneous or gastrointestinal EMI nodules in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. Fibroblasts attracted migration of the C1Q+ leukemia cells through C1Q-gC1QR recognition and subsequent stimulation of TGF-&#946;1.

As their evolution is determined by factors that enable certain cellular subsets to outcompete others, techniques that resolve cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level are ideally placed to provide new insights into MPN biology. With these insights comes the potential to uncover new approaches to predict the clinical course and treat these cancers, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. MPNs present a particularly tractable model of cancer evolution, as most patients present in an early disease phase and only a small proportion progress to aggressive disease. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the groundbreaking technological advances in single-cell omics have been pioneered by their application in MPNs.

These risk variants were 10-fold more enriched in Japanese MN cases (n=4,461) compared to a Japanese general population (n=20,238). This enrichment of DDX41 risk alleles was much more prominent in male than female (20.7 vs. 5.0). P/LP DDX41 variants conferred a large risk of developing MNs, which was negligible until 40 years old but rapidly increased to 49% by 90 years of age. DDX41-mutated MDS patients rapidly progressed to AML, which was, however, confined to those having truncating variants. Co-mutation patterns at diagnosis and at progression to AML were substantially different between DDX41-mutated and -WT cases, where none of the co-mutations affected clinical outcomes. Even TP53 mutations made no exceptions and their dismal effect, including multi-hit allelic status, on survival was almost completely mitigated by the presence of DDX41 mutations.

While all cell types secrete inactive, latent TGF-b1, only a few activate the cytokine via cell type-specific mechanisms. The cellular source of the active TGF-b1 implicated in PMF is not known. Transmembrane protein GARP binds and activates latent TGF-b1 on the surface of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and MKs or platelets.

GARP:TGF-b1 blockade reduced not only fibrosis, but also clonal expansion of transformed cells. Using mice carrying a genetic deletion of Garp in either Tregs or MKs, we found that the therapeutic effects of GARP:TGF-b1 blockade in PMF imply targeting GARP on Tregs. These therapeutic effects, accompanied by increased IFN-g signals in the spleen, were lost upon CD8 T cell depletion.

The sensitivity and specificity of excerno are adversely affected by the cosine similarity between the baseline and FFPE signatures (cosFFPE).

When sufficient levels of SIRT1 are expressed, it catalyzes the deacetylation of IGF2BP2, which can bind to the ATP6V1A transcript but does not mediate its degradation. However, when SIRT1 expression is low, the acetylated form of IGF2BP2 accumulates, and upon binding to the ATP6V1A transcript recruits the XRN2 nuclease, which catalyzes transcript degradation. Thus, the stability of the ATP6V1A transcript is significantly compromised in breast cancer cells when SIRT1 expression is low or knocked-down. This leads to a reduction in the expression of functional v-ATPase complexes in cancer cells and to an impairment in their lysosomal activity, resulting in the production of a cellular secretome consisting of increased numbers of exosomes enriched in ubiquitinated protein cargo and soluble hydrolases, including cathepsins, that together combine to promote tumor cell survival and invasiveness.

Here, we show that tumor sialylation correlates with distinct immune states and reduced survival in human cancers. The targeted removal of Siglec ligands in the tumor microenvironment, using an antibody-sialidase conjugate, enhanced antitumor immunity and halted tumor progression in several murine models. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we revealed that desialylation repolarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We also identified Siglec-E as the main receptor for hypersialylation on TAMs. Last, we found that genetic and therapeutic desialylation, as well as loss of Siglec-E, enhanced the efficacy of ICB.

Female mice were preferentially affected with myocarditis compared to male mice, consistent with a previously described genetic model of ICI myocarditis and emerging clinical data. Mechanistically, myocardial tissue from ICI-treated mice, the genetic mouse model, and human heart tissue from affected patients with ICI myocarditis all exhibited down-regulation of MANF (mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) and HSPA5 (heat shock 70-kDa protein 5) in the heart; this down-regulation was particularly notable in female mice. ICI myocarditis was amplified by heart-specific genetic deletion of mouse Manf and was attenuated by administration of recombinant MANF protein, suggesting a causal role.

Here, we showed that nuclear PKM2 (S37P-PKM2) in cardiomyocytes interacts with prosurvival and proapoptotic transcription factors, including GATA4, GATA6, and P53. Cardiomyocyte-specific PKM2-deficient mice (Pkm2 Mut Cre+) developed age-dependent dilated cardiac dysfunction and had decreased amounts of GATA4 and GATA6 (GATA4/6) but increased amounts of P53 compared to Control Cre+&#160;hearts. Nuclear PKM2 prevented caspase-1-dependent cleavage and degradation of GATA4/6 while also providing a molecular platform for MDM2-mediated reduction of P53. In a preclinical heart failure mouse model, nuclear PKM2 and GATA4/6 were decreased, whereas P53 was increased in cardiomyocytes. Loss of nuclear PKM2 was ubiquitination dependent and associated with the induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM35.

This can result in hemodynamic instability in the presence of other bleeding sources. It is oftentimes difficult to diagnose due to its limitations to visual inspection of the oropharyngeal structures. It is commonly mistaken for hemoptysis or hematemesis upon initial evaluation. Trauma, infection, pulmonary pathologies (ie, lung cancer or tuberculosis), gastrointestinal pathologies (ie, esophageal/gastric varices, Mallory-Weiss tears, esophagitis), coagulopathies, medications, and prolonged intubation have been shown to increase the risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old man with a medical history of alcohol use disorder, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and gastric varices presented with altered mental status. He was subsequently intubated for airway protection. Bleeding from the oropharynx was later found. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and bronchoscopy were unrevealing. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck revealed active bleeding of the right posterior pharyngeal artery, which was emergently embolized. Over the next few days, he continued to bleed from the oropharynx and became hemodynamically unstable. CTA abdomen showed bleeding from gastric varices and large-volume hemoperitoneum with multiple sources of active bleeding from the liver, duodenum, and jejunum. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage and gastric variceal bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic shock in a cirrhotic patient with multiple predisposing factors. If a patient presents with spontaneous oropharyngeal hemorrhage, clinicians should consider bleeding from the oropharynx if EGD and bronchoscopy are unrevealing.

However, for many years, the inherent high affinity of CO for hemoglobin severely impeded the clinical transformation of CO-based treatments. Therefore, the controlled delivery of CO to target tissues has become a common challenge. Herein, an efficient ultrasonic-triggered and targeted CO release strategy was constructed based on a novel targeted acoustic release carrier of carbon monoxide (TARC-CO) that we synthesized in this study. The designed TARC-COs could afford a safe, stable, and ultrasound-guided delivery of CO in vivo by loading a specified dose of CO inside microbubbles, resulting in breast tumor suppression. Taking advantage of the high loading capacity of microbubbles, the unit volume of TARC-CO suspension could encapsulate up to 337.1 &#177; 8.0 (&#215;103 ppm) of CO. In addition, the satisfactory ultrasound contrast-enhanced ability of TARC-COs achieved real-time interactive guidance and visual policing of CO delivery. For the in vitro antitumor study, TARC-COs with ultrasonic irradiation were demonstrated to effectively induce mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the apoptosis of 4T1 cells. In addition, we realized that TARC-CO-based treatment could significantly slow the growth rate of tumors by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells, and limiting tumor angiogenesis.

To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-&#945; subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1&#946; exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2&#945; specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Using Cut&Run and RNA-seq as orthogonal genomic approaches we also confirmed IDR-dependent binding and activation of a specific subset of HIF-target genes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of IDRs in regulating the TF search and binding process that contribute to functional target site selectivity on chromatin.", "query": "cancer"}, "36322450": {"ArticleTitle": "Liquid Biopsy and Immuno-Oncology for Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.", "AbstractText": "In the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer without oncogenic addiction.

In this article, approaches that address these challenges are assessed. Using retrospective analysis of a recent ATAD2 hit-identification campaign, alongside other examples of successful fragment-screening campaigns, it is suggested that hit validation and prioritization are best achieved by a `triangulation' approach in which the results of multiple available biochemical and biophysical techniques are correlated to develop qualitative structure-activity relationships (SARs).

An initial response to an epithelial wound is an increase in cytosolic calcium followed by complex calcium signaling events. While these calcium signals are driven by both physical and chemical wound responses, cells around the wound will all be equipped with the same cellular components to produce and interact with the calcium signals. Here, we have developed a mathematical model in the context of laser-ablation of the Drosophila pupal notum that integrates tissue-level damage models with a cellular calcium signaling toolkit. The model replicates experiments in the contexts of control wounds as well as knockdowns of specific cellular components, but it also provides new insights that are not easily accessible experimentally. The model suggests that cell-cell variability is necessary to produce calcium signaling events observed in experiments, it quantifies calcium concentrations during wound-induced signaling events, and it shows that intercellular transfer of the molecule IP3 is required to coordinate calcium signals across distal cells around the wound. The mathematical model developed here serves as a framework for quantitative studies in both wound signaling and calcium signaling in the Drosophila system.

Here, we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Ttbk2fl/fl; UBC-CreERT+ embryos (hereafter Ttbk2cmut) to dissect the role of TTBK2 in cilium stability. This system depletes TTBK2 levels after cilia formation, allowing us to assess the molecular changes to the assembled cilium over time. As a consequence of Ttbk2 deletion, the ciliary axoneme is destabilized and primary cilia are lost within 48-72 hours following recombination. Axoneme destabilization involves an increased frequency of cilia breaks and a reduction in axonemal microtubule modifications. Cilia loss was delayed by using inhibitors that affect actin-based trafficking. At the same time, we find that TTBK2 is required to regulate the composition of the centriolar satellites and to maintain the basal body pools of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins.

None of the estimated daily intake values exceeded the tolerable intake based on the consumption under consideration. Nonetheless, the accumulative hazard values evidenced a potential risk to human health, Pb and Hg being those giving a higher target hazard quotient. The cancer risk from exposure to As from fish consumption in children was above the \"acceptable\" risk to life.

Similar to their micron-scale counterparts, microbubbles (1-10 &#956;m), they can act as ultrasound contrast agents as well as locally enhance therapeutic uptake. Recently, it has been shown that the reduced size of NBs (<1 &#956;m) promotes increased uptake and accumulation in tumor interstitial space, which can enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic performance. However, accurate characterization of NB size and concentration is challenging and may limit their translation into clinical use. Their submicron nature limits accuracy of conventional microscopy techniques, while common light scattering techniques fail to distinguish between subpopulations present in NB samples (i.e., bubbles and liposomes). Due to the difficulty in the characterization of NBs, relatively little is known about the influence of size on their therapeutic performance. In this study, we describe a novel method of using a commercially available nanoparticle tracking analysis system, to distinguish between NBs and liposomes based on their differing optical properties. We used this technique to characterize three NB populations of varying size, isolated via centrifugation, and subsequently used this to assess their potential for enhancing localized delivery. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were used to quantify the ultrasound enhanced uptake of fluorescent dextran into live colorectal cancer cells. Our results showed that the amount of localized uptake did not follow the expected trends, in which larger NB populations out-perform smaller NBs, at matched concentration. To understand this observed behavior, the stability of each NB population was assessed. It was found that dilution of the NB samples from their stock concentration influences their stability, and it is hypothesized that both the total free lipid and interbubble distance play a role in NB lifetime, in agreement with previously proposed theories and models.", "query": "cancer"}, "36322168": {"ArticleTitle": "Rare Association Between Osteogenesis Imperfecta and Chondrosarcoma: Could a Pathogenic Variant in the Gene SERPINF1 Explain It?", "AbstractText": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI is a rare inherited disorder of the connective tissue caused by pathogenic variants in&#160;SERPINF1 gene, which encodes the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).

In recent years, telerehabilitation has opened a new pathway for nurses to manage chronic diseases at a distance; however, it remains unclear which chronic disease patients benefit the most from this innovative delivery mode.This study aims to summarize current components of community-based, nurse-led telerehabilitation programs using the chronic care model; evaluate the effectiveness of nurse-led telerehabilitation programs compared with traditional face-to-face rehabilitation programs; and compare the effects of telerehabilitation on patients with different chronic diseases.A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using 6 databases for articles published from 2015 to 2021. Studies comparing the effectiveness of telehealth rehabilitation with face-to-face rehabilitation for people with hypertension, cardiac diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer, or stroke were included. Quality of life was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included physical indicators, self-care, psychological impacts, and health-resource use. The revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was employed to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model and illustrated with forest plots.A total of 26 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Telephone follow-ups were the most commonly used telerehabilitation delivery approach.

All patients were treated within the ERAS protocol.The primary outcome was the time to first defecation. Secondary outcomes included other patient-reported outcome measures, length of postoperative hospital stay, readmission rate within 30 days, and incidence of postoperative complications and adverse events.A total of 249 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups. After the exclusion of 1 patient because of a diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis, 248 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.2 [11.4] years; 153 men [61.7%]) were included in the analyses. The median (IQR) time to first defecation was 76.4 (67.6-96.8) hours in the EA group and 90.0 (73.6-100.3) hours in the SA group (mean difference, -8.76; 95% CI, -15.80 to -1.73; P&#8201;=&#8201;.003). In the EA group compared with the SA group, the time to first flatus (median [IQR], 44.3 [37.0-58.2] hours vs 58.9 [48.2-67.4] hours; P < .001) and the tolerability of semiliquid diet (median [IQR], 105.8 [87.0-120.3] hours vs 116.5 [92.0-137.0] hours; P = .01) and solid food (median [IQR], 181.8 [149.5-211.4] hours vs 190.3 [165.0-228.5] hours; P = .01) were significantly decreased. Prolonged POI occurred in 13 of 125 patients (10%) in the EA group vs 25 of 123 patients (20%) in the SA group (risk ratio [RR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27-0.95; P&#8201;=&#8201;.03). Other secondary outcomes were not different between groups. There were no severe adverse events.Results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with the ERAS protocol, EA shortened the duration of POI and decreased the risk for prolonged POI compared with SA. EA may be considered as an adjunct to the ERAS protocol to promote gastrointestinal function recovery and prevent prolonged POI after surgery.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR2000038444.", "query": "cancer"}, "36322028": {"ArticleTitle": "Branched-chain amino acid supplementation suppresses the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content in mouse skeletal muscle.", "AbstractText": "Exercise training enhances oxidative capacity whereas detraining reduces mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle. The strategy to suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content has not been fully elucidated. As previous studies reported that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) ingestion increased mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, we evaluated whether BCAA supplementation could suppress the detraining-induced reduction of mitochondrial content. Six-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were randomly divided into four groups as follows: control (Con), endurance training (Tr), detraining (DeTr), and detraining with BCAA supplementation (DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA). Mice in Tr, DeTr, and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA performed treadmill running exercises [20-30&#8201;m/min, 60&#8201;min, 5 times/week, 4&#8201;weeks]. Then, mice in DeTr and DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA were administered with water or BCAA [0.6&#160;mg/g of body weight, twice daily] for 2&#8201;weeks of detraining. In whole skeletal muscle, mitochondrial enzyme activities and protein content were decreased after 2&#8201;weeks of detraining, but the reduction was suppressed by BCAA supplementation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; coactivator-1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;) protein content, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, was decreased by detraining irrespective of BCAA ingestion. Regarding mitochondrial degradation, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19&#8201;kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitophagy-related protein, was significantly higher in the Tr group than in the DeTr&#8201;+&#8201;BCAA group, but not different from in the DeTr group. With respect to mitochondrial quality, BCAA ingestion did not affect oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in isolated mitochondria.

Diversity loss was graded into three levels of conditioning-associated microbiota injury (CMBI) in a multivariable model that included antibiotic exposures. High-intensity regimens, such as total body irradiation (TBI)-thiotepa-cyclophosphamide, were associated with the greatest injury loss (CMBI III). In contrast, the non-myeloablative regimen fludarabine-cyclophosphamide with low-dose TBI (Flu/Cy/TBI200) had a low-grade injury (CMBI I). The risk of acute graft-versus-host disease correlated with CMBI degree.

Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT in detecting PM based on studies providing head-to-head comparisons between the two tests. Evidence Acquisition: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through July 2022 to identify studies reporting head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT for detection of PM. Reference standard was classified as histopathology in all patients, or as combination of histopathology, clinical, imaging, laboratory, and follow-up information (i.e., multidisciplinary reference standard). Random-effects statistical model was applied to conduct a meta-analysis of tests' diagnostic performances in patient-based and lesion-based analyses. QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C tools were used to assess study quality. Evidence Synthesis: Eleven studies were included; patient-based analysis comprised nine studies with 340 patients, and lesion-based analysis comprised four studies with 222 lesions. Pooled sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was significantly higher than that of FDG PET/CT in patient-based analysis [98.2% (95% CI: 96.1-100.0%) vs 55.9% (95% CI: 33.9-77.9%)] and lesion-based analysis [99.9% (95% CI: 99.5-100.0%) vs 27.3% (95% CI: 11.2-43.4%)]. Eight studies were rated as high risk of bias in the reference standard domain because the multidisciplinary reference standard was not sufficiently explained and may have included one of the two index tests, which would have artificially increased sensitivity. Specificity was reported in three studies as 100.0% for both tests; these studies were considered at uncertain risk of bias in the patient selection domain because patients with benign peritoneal conditions may have been excluded, resulting in underestimation of potential false-positive results. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests excellent sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for the detection of PM, in comparison to poorer sensitivity of FDG PET/CT. However, most included studies had high risk of bias, with need for further studies that could more convincingly characterize true- and false-positive results.

Eighty-one patients (38 men, 43 women; mean age, 60.5&#177;8.9 years; lobectomy in 43, limited resection in 38) were included. Patients underwent thoracic DECT and PFT evaluation preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Pulmonary lobes were segmented. Lobar volume and perfusion ratios (both relative to whole-lung values) were computed. Perfusion measures reflected DECT-derived iodine content. Patients completed 6-month postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires.

This method, termed LTM, is an in silico screen to infer genetic influences on circadian clock function. LTM uses natural variation in gene expression in human data and directly links gene expression variation to clock strength independent of longitudinal data. We applied LTM to three human skin and one melanoma datasets and found that the cell cycle is the top candidate clock-coupled pathway in healthy skin. In addition, we applied LTM to thousands of tumor samples from 11 cancer types in the TCGA database and found that extracellular matrix organization-related pathways are tightly associated with the clock strength in humans. Further analysis shows that clock strength in tumor samples are correlated with the proportion of cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

Accordingly, realgar was more sensitive to KRAS mutant cells. Transcriptome sequencing test indicated that there were 481 different expression genes in H23 cells treated with realgar. In H23 cells treated with realgar, mitochondria shrank, inner membrane folding was disturbed, and mitochondrial membrane potential crushed.

Its target antigen was identified as the bromodomain&#8209;containing protein 2 (BRD2), a transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional control of diverse genes. BRD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues of the H&#8209;ras12V&#8209;tg mouse and human subjects, as demonstrated using western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis, with the BRD2 autoantibody. In addition, the truncated BRD2 reactive to the BRD2 autoantibody was detected in tumor cell&#8209;derived exosomes, which possibly activated TA immune responses and the generation of autoantibodies. For the detection of the serum BRD2 autoantibody, epitope mimicries of autoantigenic BRD2 were screened from a random cyclic peptide CX7C library with the BRD2 autoantibody. A mimotope with the sequence of CTSVFLPHC, which was cyclized by one pair of cysteine residues, exhibited high affinity to the BRD2 autoantibody and competitively inhibited the binding of the autoantibody to the cellular BRD2 antigen.

Using a comprehensive set of mouse genetic and mechanistic studies, we show that in the appendicular skeleton, Rspo3 haplo-insufficiency and Rspo3 targeted deletion in Runx2+ osteoprogenitors lead to an increase in trabecular bone mass, with increased number of osteoblasts and bone formation. In contrast and highlighting the complexity of Wnt signaling in the regulation of skeletal homeostasis, we show that Rspo3 deletion in osteoprogenitors results in the opposite phenotype in the axial skeleton, i.e., low vertebral trabecular bone mass. Mechanistically, Rspo3 deficiency impairs the inhibitory effect of Dkk1 on Wnt signaling activation and bone mass. We demonstrate that Rspo3 deficiency leads to activation of Erk signaling which in turn, stabilizes b-catenin and Wnt signaling activation.

It affects approximately 1% of the UK population, but only one in three people is thought to have a diagnosis. Untreated coeliac disease may lead to malnutrition, anaemia, osteoporosis and lymphoma.The objectives were to define at-risk groups and determine the cost-effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in primary care.(1) Systematic review of the accuracy of potential diagnostic indicators for coeliac disease. (2) Routine data analysis to develop prediction models for identification of people who may benefit from testing for coeliac disease. (3) Systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for coeliac disease. (4) Systematic review of the accuracy of genetic tests for coeliac disease (literature search conducted in April 2021). (5) Online survey to identify diagnostic thresholds for testing, starting treatment and referral for biopsy. (6) Economic modelling to identify the cost-effectiveness of different active case-finding strategies, informed by the findings from previous objectives.For the first systematic review, the following databases were searched from 1997 to April 2021: MEDLINE&#174; (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA), Embase&#174; (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Cochrane Library, Web of Science&#8482; (Clarivate&#8482;, Philadelphia, PA, USA), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( WHO ICTRP ) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For the second systematic review, the following databases were searched from January 1990 to August 2020: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Kleijnen Systematic Reviews ( KSR ) Evidence, WHO ICTRP and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. For prediction model development, Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum and a subcohort of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used; for estimates for the economic models, Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum was used.For review 1, cohort and case-control studies reporting on a diagnostic indicator in a population with and a population without coeliac disease were eligible. For review 2, diagnostic cohort studies including patients presenting with coeliac disease symptoms who were tested with serological tests for coeliac disease and underwent a duodenal biopsy as reference standard were eligible. In both reviews, risk of bias was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects meta-analyses were fitted, in which binomial likelihoods for the numbers of true positives and true negatives were assumed.People with dermatitis herpetiformis, a family history of coeliac disease, migraine, anaemia, type 1 diabetes, osteoporosis or chronic liver disease are 1.5-2 times more likely than the general population to have coeliac disease; individual gastrointestinal symptoms were not useful for identifying coeliac disease. For children, women and men, prediction models included 24, 24 and 21 indicators of coeliac disease, respectively. The models showed good discrimination between patients with and patients without coeliac disease, but performed less well when externally validated. Serological tests were found to have good diagnostic accuracy for coeliac disease. Immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase had the highest sensitivity and endomysial antibody the highest specificity. There was little improvement when tests were used in combination. Survey respondents (n&#8201;=&#8201;472) wanted to be 66% certain of the diagnosis from a blood test before starting a gluten-free diet if symptomatic, and 90% certain if asymptomatic. Cost-effectiveness analyses found that, among adults, and using serological testing alone, immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase was most cost-effective at a 1% pre-test probability (equivalent to population screening). Strategies using immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody plus human leucocyte antigen or human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability had similar cost-effectiveness results, which were also similar to the cost-effectiveness results of immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase at a 1% pre-test probability. The most practical alternative for implementation within the NHS is likely to be a combination of human leucocyte antigen and immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing among those with a pre-test probability above 1.5%. Among children, the most cost-effective strategy was a 10% pre-test probability with human leucocyte antigen plus immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase, but there was uncertainty around the most cost-effective pre-test probability. There was substantial uncertainty in economic model results, which means that there would be great value in conducting further research.The interpretation of meta-analyses was limited by the substantial heterogeneity between the included studies, and most included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias. The main limitations of the prediction models were that we were restricted to diagnostic indicators that were recorded by general practitioners and that, because coeliac disease is underdiagnosed, it is also under-reported in health-care data. The cost-effectiveness model is a simplification of coeliac disease and modelled an average cohort rather than individuals. Evidence was weak on the probability of routine coeliac disease diagnosis, the accuracy of serological and genetic tests and the utility of a gluten-free diet.Population screening with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase (1% pre-test probability) and of immunoglobulin A endomysial antibody followed by human leucocyte antigen testing or human leucocyte antigen testing followed by immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase with any pre-test probability appear to have similar cost-effectiveness results. As decisions to implement population screening cannot be made based on our economic analysis alone, and given the practical challenges of identifying patients with higher pre-test probabilities, we recommend that human leucocyte antigen combined with immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase testing should be considered for adults with at least a 1.5% pre-test probability of coeliac disease, equivalent to having at least one predictor. A more targeted strategy of 10% pre-test probability is recommended for children (e.g. children with anaemia).Future work should consider whether or not population-based screening for coeliac disease could meet the UK National Screening Committee criteria and whether or not it necessitates a long-term randomised controlled trial of screening strategies.

Whereas, the PD-L1 expression level significantly differs, leading to a relatively low response rate to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) approaches. Therefore, improving the expression level of PD-L1 becomes one potential method to enhance the response rate. Herein, NIH 3T3 cells were educated to steadily express PD-1 protein. Furthermore, the synthesized molybdenum nitride was then coated with PD-1 protein-modified cytomembrane, which endows it with immune checkpoint blocking capability. Moreover, under the irradiation of near-infrared light, the local mild heat released from the molybdenum nitride causes the apoptosis of tumor cells. More importantly, the elevated temperature simultaneously helps elevate the expression level of PD-L1, further enhancing the response rate of ICB.

Many studies have shown that TDEs promote lung cancer metastasis and development through multiple mechanisms, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immunosuppression and the formation of a premetastatic niche. TDEs regulate these mechanisms to promote metastasis by carrying DNA, proteins, miRNA, mRNA, lncRNA and ceRNA.

Here, we found that long-term metformin exposure led to metabolic adaptation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was characterized by an obvious epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and compensatory elevation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). TOMM34, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane, was upregulated to promote tumor metastasis in response to metformin-induced metabolic stress. Mechanistically, TOMM34 interacted with ATP5B to preserve F1 FO -ATPase activity, which conferred mitochondrial OXPHOS and ATP production. This metabolic preference for OXPHOS suggested a large requirement of energy supply by cancer cells to survive and spread in response to therapeutic stress. Notably, disturbing the interaction between TOMM34 and ATP5B using Gboxin, a specific OXPHOS inhibitor, increased sensitivity to metformin and suppressed tumor progression both in&#160;vitro and in&#160;vivo.

Cell-based and cell-free biochemical assays demonstrate the absence or greatly reduced Na+ -independent mitochondrial Ca2+ release in TMBIM5 knockout or pH-sensing site mutants, respectively, and pH-dependent Ca2+ transport by recombinant TMBIM5. Taken together, we demonstrate that TMBIM5, but not LETM1, is the long-sought mitochondrial CHE, involved in setting and regulating the mitochondrial proton gradient. This finding provides the final piece of the puzzle of mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters and opens the door to exploring its importance in health and disease, and to developing drugs modulating Ca2+ exchange.", "query": "cancer"}, "36321416": {"ArticleTitle": "The budding yeast GSK-3 homologue Mck1 is an essential component of the spindle position checkpoint.", "AbstractText": "The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) is a mitotic surveillance mechanism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that prevents cells from completing mitosis in response to spindle misalignment, thereby contributing to genomic integrity. The kinase Kin4, one of the most downstream SPOC components, is essential to stop the mitotic exit network (MEN), a signalling pathway that promotes the exit from mitosis and cell division. Previous work, however, suggested that a Kin4-independent pathway contributes to SPOC, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we established the glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (GSK-3) homologue Mck1, as a novel component that works independently of Kin4 to engage SPOC. Our data indicate that both Kin4 and Mck1 work in parallel to counteract MEN activation by the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) network. We show that Mck1's function in SPOC is mediated by the pre-replication complex protein and mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (M-Cdk) inhibitor, Cdc6, which is degraded in a Mck1-dependent manner prior to mitosis. Moderate overproduction of Cdc6 phenocopies MCK1 deletion and causes SPOC deficiency via its N-terminal, M-Cdk inhibitory domain. Our data uncover an unprecedented role of GSK-3 kinases in coordinating spindle orientation with cell cycle progression.", "query": "cancer"}, "36321415": {"ArticleTitle": "POR overexpression induces tamoxifen-resistance in breast cancer through the STAT1/c-Myc pathway.", "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Although&#160;tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is widely used to treat ER-positive breast cancers, resistance to TAM remains a major clinical problem. NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is known to participate in drug metabolism and steroid metabolism. Recent studies showed that high POR expression was correlated with poor outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and POR might be a prognostic biomarker in TNBC. However, the role of POR in TAM resistance is still elusive. In this study, we found that high POR expression was associated with poor prognosis of ER-positive and TAM-treated breast cancer patients. In addition, COX analysis showed that POR expression was an independent prognostic biomarker for ER-positive as well as TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Furthermore, our results suggested that POR overexpression promoted TAM resistance by activating the STAT1/c-Myc pathway in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that high POR/STAT1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis in TAM-treated breast cancer patients. Notably, combined treatment with TAM and a specific STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine was more effective for inhibiting TAM-resistant breast cancer cells. Altogether, our findings suggested that POR overexpression induced TAM resistance through STAT1/c-Myc pathway and might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in TAM-treated breast cancer patients.

Recently, GATOR1 (Gap Activity TOward Rags 1) complexes have been shown to play an important role in regulating tumor growth. NPRL2 is a critical component of the GATOR1 complex. Therefore, this study used NPRL2 knockdown to investigate how GATORC1 regulates the prognosis and development of HCC via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and autophagy signaling pathways. We established HepG2 cells with NPRL2 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) systems. The siRNA-mediated and shRNA-mediated NPRL2 down-regulation significantly reduced the expression of NPRL2 and two other GATPOR1 complex components, NPRL3 and DEPDC5, in HepG2 cells; furthermore, the efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 protein expression by both the shRNA and siRNA systems enhanced the proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. Additionally, the NPRL2 down-regulation significantly increased HCC growth in the subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft mouse models. The NPRL2 down-regulation increased the Rag GTPases and mTOR activation and inhibited autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the NPRL2 level in the tumors was significantly associated with mortality, recurrence, the serum alpha fetoprotein level, the tumor size, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Low NPRL2, NPRL3, DEPDC5, and LC3, and high p62 and mTOR protein expression in the tumors was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival in 300 patients with HCC after surgical resection. Conclusion: The efficient down-regulation of NPRL2 significantly increased HCC proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro, and increased HCC growth in vivo.

A neoadjuvant (preoperative) approach to radiation therapy avoids these limitations and offers improved patient convenience. This study assessed the efficacy of neoadjuvant SRS as a new treatment paradigm for patients with brain metastases.A retrospective review was performed at a single institution to identify patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS (specifically, Gamma Knife radiosurgery) followed by resection of a brain metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate risks of progression and death. Assessments were made of local recurrence and leptomeningeal spread. Additionally, an analysis of the contemporary literature of postoperative and neoadjuvant SRS for metastatic disease was performed.Twenty-four patients who had undergone neoadjuvant SRS followed by resection of a brain metastasis were identified in the single-institution cohort. The median age was 64 years (range 32-84 years), and the median follow-up time was 16.5 months (range 1 month to 5.7 years). The median radiation dose was 17 Gy prescribed to the 50% isodose. Rates of local disease control were 100% at 6 months, 87.6% at 12 months, and 73.5% at 24 months. In 4 patients who had local treatment failure, salvage therapy included repeat resection, laser interstitial thermal therapy, or repeat SRS. One hundred thirty patients (including the current cohort) were identified in the literature who had been treated with neoadjuvant SRS prior to resection.

This study presents radiographic local control rates post-SBRT, systematically compares measurements acquired according to WHO and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and explores the relationship to patient outcome.The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively obtained data from a cohort of 59 consecutive patients (81 metastatic isocenters) treated with SBRT and followed with serial MRI scans. Measurements were performed by a neuroradiologist blinded to the patients' clinical course. Local control status was determined according to both WHO and RECIST measurements, and agreement between the measuring methodologies was calculated and reported.Eighty-one isocenters (111 vertebral bodies) were treated with SBRT. The mean treatment dose was 13.96 Gy and the median follow-up duration was 10.8 months, during which 408 MRI scans were evaluated with both WHO and RECIST criteria for each scan point. Imaging demonstrated a mean unidimensional size decrease of 0.2 cm (p = 0.14) and a mean area size decrease of 0.99 cm2 (p = 0.03). Although 88% of the case classifications were concordant and the agreement was significant, WHO criteria were found to be more sensitive to tumor size change. The local control rates according to WHO and RECIST were 95% and 98%, respectively.Although WHO volumetric measurements are admittedly superior for tumor size measurement, RECIST is simpler, reproducible, and for the first time is shown here to be comparable to WHO criteria. Thus, the application of RECIST methodology appears to be a suitable standard for evaluating post-SBRT treatment response.

However, the normal-dose CT (NDCT) corresponding to a specific LDCT (it is regareded as the label of the LDCT, which is necessary for supervised learning) are very difficult to obtain. So that the application of supervised learning methods in LDCT reconstruction is limited. It is necessary to construct a unsupervised deep learning framework for LDCT reconstruction that does not depend on paired LDCT-NDCT&#160;datasets.We presented an unsupervised learning framework for the transferring from the identity mapping to the low-dose recontruction task, called Marginal Distribution Adaptation in Multi-scale (MDAM). For NDCTs as source domain data, MDAM is an identity map with two parts: firstly, it establishes a dimensionality reduction mapping, which can obtain the same feature distribution from NDCTs and LDCTs; and then NDCTs is retrieved by reconstructing the image overview and details from the low-dimensional features. For the purpose of the feature transfer between source domain and target domain (LDCTs), we introduce the multi-scale feature extraction in the MDAM, and then eliminate differences in probability distributions of these multi-scale features between NDCTs and LDCTs through wavelet decomposition and domain adaptation&#160;learning.Image quality evaluation metrics and subjective quality scores show that, as an unsupervised method, the performance of the MDAM approaches or even surpasses some state-of-the-art supervised methods.

To date, no efficient treatment is available for GBC patients. Based on the data from cBioPortal, TIMER, and GDSC, we performed an unbiased screening with 25 candidate compounds that predominantly target ErbB family and identified HKI-272, a highly selective EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor, displayed decreased IC50 values in three GBC cell lines. HKI-272 not only promoted gemcitabine-mediated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects and induced cell cycle arrest in GBC, but also enhanced gemcitabine-induced suppressive effects of GBC cell migration and invasion by inhibiting pathways downstream of EGFR. Furthermore, HKI-272, together with gemcitabine, effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastases in mouse models. Immunostaining and HE staining data from both primary tumor and lung metastasis indicated that the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects were mediated through EGFR suppression. Moreover, the expression of EGFR, measured by both immunostaining and HE staining, was correlated with a poor prognosis in GBC.

It was determined that the tumor buds were divided into low and high grades. Tumor budding and other prognostic factors were compared using the chi-square test. It was considered significant if the p-value was less than or equal to 0.05. Results:&#160;There were 110 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, which accounts for more than half of the total cases (88.18%). A total of 144 tumors were present, of which 74 displayed strong budding and 36 displayed poor budding. A correlation between tumor budding and tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage is statistically significant (P = 0.0099). Conclusion: Tumor budding in breast cancer is an easily visible in microscopy, novel prognostic indicator. A new prognostic element may be added to the reporting process.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320966": {"ArticleTitle": "A Multidisciplinary Approach and Current Perspective of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review.", "AbstractText": "In recent times, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been considered one of the major causes of liver disease across the world. NAFLD is defined as the deposition of triglycerides in the liver and is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance (IR), fatty liver, hepatocyte injury, unbalanced proinflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, and fibrosis are the main pathogenesis in NAFLD. Recent studies suggest that the action of intestinal microbiota through chronic inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and energy uptake plays a vital role in NAFLD. Moreover, polycystic ovarian syndrome also causes NAFLD development through IR. Age, gender, race, ethnicity, sleep, diet, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic and epigenetic pathways are some contributing factors of NAFLD that can exacerbate the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#160;and eventually lead to death. NAFLD has various presentations, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, bloating, upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, poor sleep, increased thirst, palpitation, and a feeling of warmth. Some studies have shown that NAFLD with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has poor outcomes. The gold standard for NAFLD diagnosis is liver biopsy. Other diagnostic tools are imaging tests, serum biomarkers, microbiota markers, and tests for extrahepatic complications. There are no specific treatments for NAFLD. Therefore, the main concern for NAFLD is treating the comorbid conditions such as anti-diabetic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus, statins to reduce HCC progression, antioxidants to prevent hepatocellular damage, and bariatric surgery for patients with a BMI&#160;of >40 kg/m2 and >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities. Lifestyle and dietary changes are considered preventive strategies against NAFLD advancement. Inadequate treatment of NAFLD further leads to cardiac consequences, sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. In this systematic review, we have briefly discussed the risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical features, and numerous consequences of NAFLD. We have also reviewed various guidelines for NAFLD diagnosis along with existing therapeutic strategies for the management and prevention of the disease.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320942": {"ArticleTitle": "Electronic Cigarettes for Smoking Cessation: The Gap Between Behavior in Smokers and Medical Education.", "AbstractText": "E-cigarettes have engendered a great deal of controversy within the public health and medical communities.&#160; Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were administered.

We show that this electron transfer occurs via hydrogen bonding and that in aqueous solutions of pyruvic acid, the hydrated form is the electron acceptor.

This was done using a six-point Likert scoring system of seven questions that were scaled from 1 to 6.More than 80% of patients somewhat to strongly agreed that telemedicine met their healthcare needs, improved their confidence in their healthcare system, and were generally satisfied with the quality of care provided. Nearly all patients (90%) understood their physicians' recommendations over the phone. In addition, more than half of the patients (89%) felt they could freely communicate their concerns. Patients also showed an inclination towards face-to-face consultations at 68%; however, 90% were willing to participate in future teleconsultations.Our study indicates an overall positive experience among patients towards the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine is a safe, futuristic approach toward patient care management and, thus, provides healthcare professionals a platform to implement further patient and physician education. Even though our data also showed that patients liked in-person visits to some degree, this needs to be looked into more in future studies.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320655": {"ArticleTitle": "A cross-sectional study of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity of Jordanian population.", "AbstractText": "Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11th March 2020, the public health recommendations have applied lockdowns and restrictions to limit the spread of the disease. These measures determined outdoor activities and access to many forms of exercise.The primary objective of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity (PA) of the Jordanian population.A cross-sectional online survey was designed using Google Forms services and distributed on social media platforms during the first two weeks of November 2020 to evaluate the exercise activity changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in the study population. In this research, we included those who perform any form of physical activity (n&#8201;=&#8201;1103). The data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM SPSS Corp, SPSS Statistics ver. 26, USA). The categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and proportions and were compared using the Chi-square. For all analyses, P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 1103 out of 2,511 (43.9%) respondents who participated in the survey were physically exercising during the COVID-19 pandemic. 41.8% were exercising at an irregular frequency, while 21.5% were exercising daily, 16.8% were exercising three to five times a week, and 19.9% were exercising once or twice a week. Moreover, 282 (25.6%) respondents started doing some form of exercise during the pandemic. Those significantly were less than 18-year-old, male gender, were single, were non-smokers, and had a diploma or bachelor's degree in a health-related major. These changes in the level of exercise have been attributed by 57.8% of respondents to the health aspects where they realized the importance of exercising in strengthening the immune system against diseases, including COVID-19.The current study showed that lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a positive impact on the healthy lifestyle of the Jordanian population which was attributed to their feeling of the importance of sports practice on the immune system and the availability of time for those activities. However, the younger and individuals were more aware of the importance of these practices which highlights the importance of considering other age groups in future studies of healthy behaviors.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320651": {"ArticleTitle": "Identifying unmet information needs of advanced cancer patients in Iran: An in-depth qualitative study.", "AbstractText": "One of the main vital needs for self-care in patients with advanced cancer is information need. Meeting this need has significant positive effects on improving their treatment and care. This study was conducted to identify the unmet information needs of patients with advanced cancer in Iran.This exploratory study was performed from July to February 2021 in the Kerman University of Medical Sciences cancer treatment centers. Oncologists selected eligible patients by purposeful sampling method. Semistructured and in-depth interviews were conducted with selected patients to collect data. Interviews continued until data saturation. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.In the interviews, 15 patients with advanced cancer ranging in age from 43 to 65 years participated. The most common type of cancer in women was breast (71.4%) and prostate (50%) in men. The two main categories of \"types of unmet information needs\" and \"reasons for not meeting information needs\" were extracted from the analysis of patient interviews, with six and four subcategories, respectively.Cancer patients had a large number of unmet information needs. At the time of identifying the unmet information needs of cancer patients, the basic reasons for not meeting these needs should also be considered because cultural differences and social gaps in societies are inevitable.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320648": {"ArticleTitle": "Satisfaction with care provided by home-based palliative care service to the cancer patients in Dhaka City of Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.", "AbstractText": "Patient satisfaction is an important quality indicator of health care service. The concept of home-based palliative care has been recently introduced in Bangladesh, but the patients' satisfaction with this care remained unexplored. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction of the cancer patients receiving this care.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 51 surviving cancer patients above 18 years of age registered under the home-based care service of the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire based on the FAMCARE P16 questionnaire from February to March 2019. Descriptive analysis was done for the sociodemographic and satisfaction-related indicators. A correlation matrix was done to see the correlation among the satisfaction indicators.The majority of the patients (88.2%) were satisfied with the service provided by the home care team. Most (76.5%) of the patients were women, and the mean age was 56.25&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14.8 years. The median duration of getting home-based care was 4 months. Main satisfaction indicators were-assessment of physical symptoms (70.6%), providing information about pain management (70.6%), the inclusion of the family in decision making (76.5%), coordination of care between the members of the home care team (84.3%) and availability of doctors, nurses and palliative care assistants (74.5%). A high correlation was observed between satisfaction regarding the care of physical symptoms and provision of information (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.814, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Also, satisfaction regarding the provision of information and support provided to the family is highly correlated (R&#8201;=&#8201;0.722, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).Despite the limitations, the overall satisfaction level of the patients regarding home-based palliative care services in Bangladesh is very high.

Identifying the functional changes by metaproteomics helps understand the disease-related dysbiosis, yet characterizing low-abundant bacteria is challenging. Here, we developed a free-flow isoelectric focusing electrophoresis-mass spectrometry- (FFIEF-MS-) based metaproteomics strategy to reduce host interferences and enrich low-abundant bacteria for in-depth interpretation of the oral microbiome. With our method, the number of interfering peptides decreased by 52.87%, whereas the bacterial peptides and species increased by 94.97% and 44.90%, respectively, compared to the conventional metaproteomics approach. We identified 3647 bacterial proteins, which is the most comprehensive oral metaproteomics study to date. Lung cancer-associated bacteria were validated among an independent cohort. The imbalanced Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella histicola and their dysregulated functions in inhibiting immune response and maintaining cell redox homeostasis were revealed.

Despite typically low toxicity in vertebrates, IMI exposure is associated with liver and gastrointestinal toxicity. The mechanism underlying IMI toxicity in mammals is unclear. Pesticide exposure frequently activates xenobiotic nuclear receptors, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), to induce detoxification phase I and phase II genes. This study examined the role of CAR in mediating IMI off-target toxicity. Female Car-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were orally administered imidacloprid (50 mg/kg, twice daily) for 21 days, following which serum, liver, and intestinal tissues were collected. Liver tissue analysis indicated mild inflammation and induction of detoxification gene Cyp2b10 in IMI-exposed WT mice. The absence of CAR increased hepatic IMI accumulation. Microbiome analysis of ileal samples revealed IMI altered microbial diversity in a genotype-specific manner, with increased &#945;-diversity in Car-/- mice while decreased &#945;-diversity in WT mice. We observed Car-/- mice exhibit intestinal alterations with decreased CYP-P450 expression, blunted villi height, and increased small intestine length and weight independent of IMI exposure. Our results suggest that IMI is not overtly toxic. However, the absence of xenobiotic nuclear receptor CAR allows increased accumulation of IMI in the liver and disrupts the villi structure and Cyp gene expression in the intestine.", "query": "cancer"}, "36320614": {"ArticleTitle": "[Quality Assurance of Screening Colonoscopy in Austria and Europe].", "AbstractText": "Screening colonoscopy, an efficient tool for reducing the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer, is only effective if it is performed under high quality standards.

Therefore, we developed a sensitive and efficient biosensor using polyadenine (polyA)-mediated fluorescent spherical nucleic acid (FSNA) for miRNA analysis based on strand displacement reactions on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surfaces and electrokinetic signal amplification (ESA) on a microfluidic chip. In this FSNA, polyA-DNA biosensor was anchored on AuNP surfaces via intrinsic affinity between adenine and Au. The upright conformational polyA-DNA recognition block hybridized with 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled reporter-DNA, resulting in fluorescence quenching of FSNA probes induced by AuNP-based resonance energy transfer. Reporter DNA was replaced in the presence of target miRNA, leading to the recovery of reporter-DNA fluorescence. Subsequently, reporter-DNAs were accumulated and detected in the front of with Nafion membrane in the microchannel by ESA. Our method showed high selectivity and sensitivity with a limit of detection of 1.3 pM. This method could also be used to detect miRNA-21 in human serum and urine samples, with recoveries of 104.0%-113.3% and 104.9%-108.0%, respectively. Furthermore, we constructed a chip with three parallel channels for the simultaneous detection of multiple tumor-related miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-141, and miRNA-375), which increased the detection efficiency.

However, to date, metabolic-related studies on QYSLD have not been performed. In this study, a post-targeted screening strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight full information tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MSE) was developed to identify QYSLD-related xenobiotics in rat urine. The chemical compound database of QYSLD constituents was established from previous research, and metabolites related to these compounds were predicted in combination with their possible metabolic pathways. The metabolites were identified by extracted ion chromatograms using predicted m/z values as well as retention time, excimer ions, and fragmentation behavior. Overall, 85 QYSLD-related xenobiotics (20 prototype compounds and 65 metabolites) were characterized from rat urine. The main metabolic reactions and elimination features of QYSLD included oxidation, reduction, decarboxylation, hydrolysis, demethylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, deglycosylation, acetylation, and associated combination reactions. Of the identified molecules, 14 prototype compounds and 58 metabolites were slowly eliminated, thus accumulating in&#160;vivo over an extended period, while five prototypes and two metabolites were present in&#160;vivo for a short duration. Furthermore, one prototype and five metabolites underwent the process of \"appearing-disappearing-reappearing\" in&#160;vivo.
